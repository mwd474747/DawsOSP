- Scenario impacts (25bps, 50bps cuts)
- Sector sensitivity matrix
- Historical parallels
- FOMC meeting playbook

#### 5. Test Housing Market Analysis
```
Should I buy a house now?
```
**Expected Output:**
- Housing cycle position (Recovery/Expansion/Recession)
- Affordability analysis (price-to-income, mortgage rates)
- Credit cycle integration
- Regional market breakdown
- Price projections (6/12/24 months)
- Buy/wait recommendations

#### 6. Test Labor Market Deep Dive
```
How's the job market?
```
**Expected Output:**
