# DawsOS - Financial Intelligence System

## Project Overview
DawsOS is a **pattern-driven financial intelligence system** built with Python and Streamlit. It uses a Trinity architecture (Request ‚Üí Executor ‚Üí Pattern ‚Üí Registry ‚Üí Agent) to orchestrate 15 specialized agents for market analysis, investment frameworks, and data governance.

## Current State
- **Status**: Running successfully on Replit
- **URL**: Port 5000 (webview configured)
- **Python Version**: 3.11
- **Framework**: Streamlit 1.50.0+

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: Streamlit web UI on port 5000
- **Backend**: Python-based agent system with knowledge graph
- **Database**: File-based JSON storage (no external DB required)
- **API Integration**: Optional APIs for real-time data (FRED, FMP, NewsAPI, etc.)

## Key Features
- 15 specialized AI agents with 104 capabilities (NEW: `can_analyze_systemic_risk`)
- 51 pre-defined analysis patterns (NEW: deep_macro_analysis with systemic risk)
- Knowledge graph for relationship mapping
- Economic dashboard and market analysis
- Pattern-based workflow execution
- **Systemic Risk Analysis** (October 2025):
  - Credit cycle tracking (expansion/peak/contraction phases)
  - Empire cycle analysis (Ray Dalio's Big Debt Cycle framework)
  - Multi-timeframe predictions (near-term + long-term structural outlook)
  - Confidence adjustment based on systemic risk factors

## Configuration
### Required Files
- `.streamlit/config.toml` - Streamlit server configuration (port 5000, headless mode)
- `dawsos/.env` - Environment variables (API keys - all optional)

### Environment Variables (All Optional)
The system works fully without API keys using cached data:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Claude AI for live responses
- `FRED_API_KEY` - Economic indicators (GDP, inflation)
- `FMP_API_KEY` - Stock quotes and fundamentals
- `NEWSAPI_KEY` - Real-time news headlines
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Optional fallback LLM
- `TRINITY_STRICT_MODE` - Architecture compliance enforcement (default: false)

### FRED Economic Data Series
**Base Indicators** (used by all patterns):
- `GDP` - Gross Domestic Product (quarterly growth)
- `CPIAUCSL` - Consumer Price Index (inflation)
- `UNRATE` - Unemployment Rate
- `FEDFUNDS` - Federal Funds Effective Rate

**Systemic Risk Indicators** (used by deep_macro_analysis pattern):
- `GFDEGDQ188S` - Federal Debt as % of GDP (debt sustainability)
- `SIPOVGINIUSA` - Gini Coefficient (income inequality, 0-1 scale)
- `HDTGPDUSQ163N` - Household Debt as % of GDP (consumer leverage)
- `TDSP` - Household Debt Service Payments as % of Disposable Income
- `DRCCLACBS` - Delinquency Rate on Credit Card Loans (credit stress)
- `EPUSOVDEBT` - Economic Policy Uncertainty Index: Sovereign Debt/Currency Crises

**Interpretation Guide**:
- **Credit Cycle Phases**:
  - Expansion: Debt/GDP < 90%, low delinquency, rising credit growth
  - Peak: Debt/GDP 90-110%, elevated delinquency (>3%), slowing credit growth
  - Contraction: Debt/GDP > 110%, high delinquency (>4%), negative credit growth
  - Trough: Deleveraging complete, low debt levels, credit growth resuming

- **Empire Cycle Stages** (Ray Dalio Framework):
  - Rising Empire: Debt/GDP < 80%, Gini < 0.40, low policy uncertainty
  - Peak Empire: Debt/GDP 80-100%, Gini 0.40-0.45, moderate uncertainty
  - Declining Empire: Debt/GDP > 100%, Gini > 0.45, high uncertainty
  - Crisis: Debt/GDP > 120%, Gini > 0.50, extreme uncertainty

- **Systemic Risk Score** (0-100 scale):
  - 0-30: Low risk - Normal economic conditions
  - 31-50: Moderate risk - Some vulnerabilities present
  - 51-70: Elevated risk - Multiple warning signals active
  - 71-100: High risk - Crisis conditions likely within 1-3 years

## Recent Changes
### Universal Pattern Rendering System (October 18, 2025)

### Replit Setup (October 17, 2025)
- Installed Python 3.11 and dependencies
- Configured Streamlit for Replit environment (port 5000, headless mode, CORS disabled)
- Removed hardcoded API keys from .env for security
- Set up workflow to run on port 5000 with webview output
- Created .streamlit/config.toml for proper proxy handling
- **Fixed API key integration**: Modified `load_env.py` to preserve Replit secrets (doesn't overwrite existing env vars)
- **Verified working**: FRED API, FMP API, Anthropic Claude API all operational

## System Grade
**A- (92/100)** - Operational with documented technical debt

**Key Metrics**:
- ‚úÖ 51 patterns operational (NEW: deep_macro_analysis with systemic risk)
- ‚úÖ 27 datasets in knowledge graph (96K+ nodes)
- ‚úÖ 15 agents with 104 capabilities (NEW: can_analyze_systemic_risk)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 6 categories of technical debt documented (template fragility, capability misuse, hybrid routing, etc.)

**See**: PROJECT_ROADMAP.md for complete remediation plan

## Known Issues (Non-Critical)
- FRED API warnings appear in logs when API key not configured (expected behavior - app uses cached data)
- seed_knowledge_graph module import error on first run (benign - graph initializes from JSON files)
- "Error in regime detection" on startup (doesn't affect functionality - uses fallback data)

- **PROJECT_ROADMAP.md** - Complete roadmap of TODOs, plans, and phases
- **KNOWN_PATTERN_ISSUES.md** - Detailed pattern-by-pattern analysis
- **SYSTEM_STATUS.md** - Known issues and technical debt
