## 💎 CORE DIFFERENTIATORS (Individual Investor Value)

### 1. Transparency (Hard to Copy)
**What**: Full execution traces, data provenance, click-to-explain

**Individual Investor Benefit**:
- "Tax season: Show your accountant the exact price + FX rate used (pricing pack: 2025-07-15_close)"
- "Understand HOW we reached every conclusion (not black box)"
- "Click any metric → See calculation + causal chain"

**Competitive Advantage**: Competitors built black boxes, retrofitting transparency requires architecture rewrite

---

### 2. Causal Knowledge Graph (Hard to Copy)
**What**: Knowledge graph with semantic relationships and elasticities

**Individual Investor Benefit**:
- "Oil prices up 20% → How does this affect MY energy stocks?" (Query: `explain_portfolio_impact("oil_spike", my_portfolio)`)
- Returns: Causal chain through YOUR specific holdings with elasticity estimates
- Example: "Your XLE position: +18% estimated impact (0.9 oil beta × 20% shock)"

**Competitive Advantage**: 2+ years head start, requires domain expertise + data infrastructure

---

### 3. Multi-Currency Done Right (Hard to Copy)
**What**: Beancount ledger + Pricing packs with WM 4pm FX rates

**Individual Investor Benefit**:
- "Canadian? European? We separate local + FX + interaction returns"
- Example: "+5.2% CAD = Local +8.1% USD + FX -2.3% + Interaction -0.6%"
- Perfect for taxes (frozen FX rate with timestamp + source)

**Competitive Advantage**: Most platforms bolt on FX as afterthought, DawsOS has professional-grade ledger

---

### 4. Professional Infrastructure at Consumer Price (Unique Position)
**What**: Beancount ledger + Pricing packs + Causal KG at $149/mo

**Individual Investor Benefit**:
- Bloomberg-level tools: $24K/year → DawsOS: $1,800/year (13x cheaper)
- Morningstar: $250/year but basic → DawsOS: 7x price, 10x capabilities
- Unique position: Professional features without professional price tag

---

## 🚧 REMOVED FROM MVP (Individual Investor Focus)

### Advisor Features (Deferred to Post-PMF):
- ❌ Multi-client management

---

### Automation (Deferred to Month 4+):
- ❌ Automated portfolio sync (Questrade, IB APIs)
- ❌ Daily morning briefing emails

---

### Advanced Analytics (Deferred to Month 6+):

- ❌ Tax-loss harvesting suggestions

**Why Defer**: Core PMF is transparency + macro integration + multi-currency. Add advanced features after validation.
