### For Individual Investors Who:
- Manage their own portfolios ($250K-$10M)

## üö´ WHAT WE'RE NOT BUILDING

- ‚ùå No advisor-specific permissioning
- ‚ùå No client portals

**Not a Trading Platform**:

## ‚úÖ WHAT WE ARE BUILDING

### Core Value Proposition (The "Why DawsOS?" Question)

**For the Individual Investor Who Asks**:
- "Why did my tech portfolio drop 15% when inflation rose?" ‚Üí DawsOS shows macro‚Üíportfolio causality
- "How will a recession affect MY holdings?" ‚Üí DawsOS calculates portfolio-weighted recession exposure
- "Can I trust this analysis?" ‚Üí DawsOS shows execution trace, data sources, confidence scores
- "I hold CAD and USD stocks, what's my real return?" ‚Üí DawsOS separates local + FX + interaction

**DawsOS Answer**:
> "We show you the causal relationships between macro conditions, sector dynamics, and your specific holdings. Every number is auditable. Every analysis is reproducible. You understand WHY, not just WHAT."

---

## üèóÔ∏è THREE ARCHITECTURAL PILLARS

### 1. **Causal Knowledge Graph** (The "Understanding" Engine)
**What**: Knowledge graph with semantic relationships and elasticities

**Individual Investor Benefit**:
- "Oil prices up 20% ‚Üí How does this affect MY energy stocks?"
- "Fed raised rates ‚Üí Show me which of MY holdings are hurt"
- Query: `explain_portfolio_impact("fed_rate_hike", my_portfolio)`
- Returns: Causal chain through YOUR specific holdings with elasticity estimates

**Example**:
```
Fed Rate: 5.3% ‚Üí 5.5% (+0.2%)
‚Üì (duration beta: -0.8)
Your AAPL position: -1.2% estimated impact
Your XLE position: +0.3% estimated impact (banks benefit)
Net portfolio: -0.6% estimated impact
```

**Why This Matters to Individuals**:
- Not generic "rising rates hurt tech" ‚Üí Specific impact on YOUR $50K AAPL position
- Not black box ‚Üí You see the causal chain
- Reproducible ‚Üí Same inputs = same outputs (for taxes/audits)

---

### 2. **Pattern System** (The "Workflow" Engine)
**What**: Composable analysis workflows that chain together

**Individual Investor Workflows**:

**Pattern**: `portfolio_recession_check`
1. Fetch current macro regime (unemployment, yield curve, GDP)
2. Calculate recession probability
3. Load YOUR portfolio holdings
4. Calculate per-holding recession beta
5. Aggregate to portfolio-level recession exposure
6. Output: "Your portfolio has 0.72 recession beta (HIGH). Top exposures: NVDA, TSLA, SHOP"

**Pattern**: `multi_currency_performance`
1. Load YOUR Beancount ledger
2. Load pricing pack (frozen prices + FX rates)
3. Calculate local returns (stock performance in local currency)
4. Calculate FX returns (currency movement)
5. Calculate interaction term (local √ó FX)
6. Output: "YTD return: +8.2% = Local: +12.5% + FX: -3.1% + Interaction: -1.2%"

**Why This Matters to Individuals**:
- One-click sophisticated analysis (don't need Bloomberg Terminal skills)
- Patterns compose ‚Üí Morning briefing runs 5 patterns in sequence
- Transparent ‚Üí Click any number to see the pattern that generated it

---

### 3. **Transparency & Auditability** (The "Trust" Engine)
**What**: Full execution traces, data provenance, reproducible results

**Individual Investor Use Cases**:

**Tax Season**:
- "What was AAPL worth on July 15, 2025 when I sold?"
- DawsOS: "AAPL: $178.42 (Pricing Pack: 2025-07-15_close, Source: Polygon, FX: USD/CAD 1.3521 WM 4pm)"
- Accountant can verify: Same pricing pack = same valuation

**Quarterly Review**:
- "My portfolio returned 3.2% this quarter. Where did that come from?"
- DawsOS: Attribution breakdown (stock selection, sector allocation, FX impact, cash drag)
- Every component traceable to source data + calculation

**Understanding an Alert**:
- DawsOS Alert: "Your portfolio recession risk increased from 0.65 ‚Üí 0.72"
- Click ‚Üí Shows execution trace:
  - Pattern: `portfolio_recession_check`
  - Agent: `pattern_spotter` (capability: `can_detect_macro_regime`)
  - Data: FRED (unemployment 3.8% ‚Üí 4.1%), Treasury (yield curve -0.05% ‚Üí -0.18%)
  - KG causal chain: Unemployment ‚Üë + Yield curve ‚Üì = Recession risk ‚Üë
  - Your holdings: NVDA has 0.85 recession beta, you hold $75K ‚Üí +$2,550 exposure
  - Confidence: 8.2/10 (all data fresh, strong historical correlation)

**Why This Matters to Individuals**:
- You're not trusting a black box ‚Üí You understand HOW the platform thinks
- Auditable for taxes/compliance
- Educational ‚Üí You learn WHY macro affects your holdings
