# Documentation Deletion Assessment — Archive Update (2025-10-26)

**Status**: Archived for governance history. The missing files highlighted in the original October 24 audit have been restored or superseded. Keep this note so reviewers understand why the earlier “critical” findings are no longer actionable.

## What Changed Since the Original Assessment

| Area | Original Finding | Current State (2025-10-26) |
|------|------------------|----------------------------|
| DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md | Deleted, breaking onboarding links | ✅ Rewritten for the DawsOSP stack (see `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`) |
| .claude/agents/* | Removed (28 files) | ✅ Restored + updated with honest status callouts |
| .claude/PATTERN_CAPABILITY_MAPPING.md | Missing | ✅ Present; referenced from CLAUDE.md |
| TASK inventory | Broken references to MASTER_TASK_LIST.md | ✅ `.ops/TASK_INVENTORY_2025-10-24.md` now the single backlog; the 10-26 draft marked Archived |
| Testing guidance | Not recreated after cleanup | ⚠️ Still pending (tracked in `.ops/TASK_INVENTORY_2025-10-24.md` P1-DOCS) |

Key commits: `e5f15f3` (restores documentation), `de35276` (aligns CLAUDE.md), current updates (this change set) keep the narrative in sync with implemented services (ScenarioService, ratings rubrics, provider transforms).

## Guidance for Future Audits

1. **Reference Live Sources**: Use `README.md`, `PRODUCT_SPEC.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`, `.ops/TASK_INVENTORY_2025-10-24.md`, and `.claude/agents/*.md` for the authoritative truth. Older Trinity 3.0 references should be treated as historical only.
2. **Avoid Re-reporting Resolved Issues**: Before filing a new documentation violation, run `rg --files` to confirm the file truly does not exist. Many previously missing guides have been rewritten for the new stack.
3. **Testing Documentation Gap**: The only outstanding gap from the original assessment is a refreshed `TESTING_GUIDE.md`. Until it exists, continue to note the deficiency but do not mark other restored docs as missing.

## Next Actions

1. Create the new testing guide (owner: P1-DOCS task).
2. Keep the `.ops/TASK_INVENTORY_2025-10-26.md` file in Archive mode to avoid conflicting single sources of truth.
3. When new documentation is added/removed, update this archive log or replace it with a fresh audit rather than reviving the outdated severity matrix.

This archive entry closes the “Documentation Deletion” incident while preserving the rationale for auditors who consult git history.
