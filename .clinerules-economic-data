## Execution Plan

1. **Initialize Components**
```python
from dawsos.core.knowledge_graph import KnowledgeGraph
from dawsos.capabilities.fred_data import FredDataCapability
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

graph = KnowledgeGraph()
fred = FredDataCapability()
```

2. **Load Each Category**
```python
def load_category(category_name, series_dict):
    print(f"\nðŸ“Š Loading {category_name}...")

    for indicator_name, series_id in series_dict.items():
        # Get 10 years of data
        end_date = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
        start_date = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=365*10)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')

        data = fred.get_series(series_id, start_date, end_date)

        # Create indicator node
        graph.add_node('economic_indicator', {
            'name': indicator_name,
            'series_id': series_id,
            'category': category_name,
            'source': 'FRED',
            'last_updated': datetime.now().isoformat()
        }, node_id=f"indicator_{series_id}")

        # Store observations
        for obs in data.get('observations', []):
            graph.add_node('indicator_value', {
                'series_id': series_id,
                'date': obs['date'],
                'value': obs['value']
            }, node_id=f"{series_id}_{obs['date']}")
```

3. **Save Progress**
```python
graph.save('dawsos/storage/graph_economic_expanded.json')
```

## Success Criteria
- Load 200+ FRED series
- 10 years of historical data per series
- All data normalized and stored in graph
- Zero placeholder values
- All nodes have timestamps

## Rate Limiting
- FRED allows 1000 requests/min
- Add 0.1 second delay between calls
- Log progress every 10 indicators

## Output Location
Save to: `dawsos/storage/graph_economic_expanded.json`

Start with Labor Market category and proceed sequentially through all 10 categories.
