## How the Quality Scoring System Works

### **Quality Score Calculation** (Line 119-145)

Quality is calculated per-node using 3 weighted factors:

```python
def _calculate_quality_from_graph(self, node_id: str) -> float:
    """Calculate data quality based on graph relationships"""

    # 1. Connection Score (30% weight)
    connections = len(node.get('connections_in', [])) + len(node.get('connections_out', []))
    connection_score = min(connections / 10, 1.0)  # Max at 10 connections

    # 2. Age Score (30% weight)
    age_hours = (datetime.now() - datetime.fromisoformat(node['modified'])).total_seconds() / 3600
    age_score = max(0, 1.0 - (age_hours / 168))  # Decay over 7 days

    # 3. Relationship Strength (40% weight)
    avg_strength = average of all edge strengths connected to this node
    strength_score = avg_strength / count if count > 0 else 0.5

    # Weighted average
    quality_score = (connection_score * 0.3 + age_score * 0.3 + strength_score * 0.4)

    return round(quality_score, 2)
```

### **Your Current Graph State**

From the logs: **"Loaded graph with 2 nodes from file"**

Let's calculate what 54% quality means with 2 nodes:

#### Scenario 1: Both nodes have low connections
```
Node 1:
  - Connections: 0 in, 0 out = 0 total
  - Connection score: 0/10 = 0.0
  - Age: Created recently = 1.0
  - Strength: No edges = 0.5 (default)
  - Quality: (0.0 * 0.3) + (1.0 * 0.3) + (0.5 * 0.4) = 0.0 + 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.50

Node 2:
  - Connections: 1 in, 1 out = 2 total
  - Connection score: 2/10 = 0.2
  - Age: Created recently = 1.0
  - Strength: 2 edges with strength 0.5 = 0.5
  - Quality: (0.2 * 0.3) + (1.0 * 0.3) + (0.5 * 0.4) = 0.06 + 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.56

Average: (0.50 + 0.56) / 2 = 0.53 ≈ 54% ✅
```

**This matches your dashboard!**

## Why No "Quality Issues" Listed

### **Issue Threshold** (Line 254)

```python
# In comprehensive_governance_check()
for node_id, node in self.graph.nodes.items():
    gov_check = self.check_governance(node_id)
    quality_scores.append(gov_check['quality_score'])

    if gov_check['quality_score'] < 0.5:  # ← Only nodes BELOW 50% are "issues"
        results['quality_issues'].append({
            'node': node_id,
            'score': gov_check['quality_score'],
            'type': node['type']
        })
```

**Key Point**: A node is only flagged as a "quality issue" if it scores **below 50%**.

---

## The Two-Tier System

### **Tier 1: Overall Health Score** (0-100%)
- **Calculation**: Average of all node quality scores
- **Purpose**: Shows overall system health
- **Your Score**: 54% = "Needs improvement"

### **Tier 2: Quality Issues** (Critical alerts)
- **Threshold**: Nodes with quality < 50%
- **Purpose**: Highlight nodes that need immediate attention
- **Your Issues**: 0 (both nodes are ≥50%)

---

## Quality Score Ranges

| Score | Label | Quality Issues? | What It Means |
|-------|-------|----------------|---------------|
| 90-100% | Excellent | No | All nodes well-connected, fresh, strong relationships |
| 70-89% | Good | No | Most nodes healthy, some room for improvement |
| 50-69% | Needs improvement | No | Nodes lack connections or aging data |
| 0-49% | Poor | **YES** | Flagged as issues - need immediate attention |

**Your situation**: 54% = "Needs improvement" tier, but no nodes in "Poor" tier.

---

## Example Breakdown (Your 2-Node Graph)

```
comprehensive_governance_check() runs:
    ↓
Node 1: quality_score = 0.50 (50%)
  ├─→ Below 0.5? NO → Not added to quality_issues list
  └─→ Added to quality_scores list: [0.50]

Node 2: quality_score = 0.56 (56%)
  ├─→ Below 0.5? NO → Not added to quality_issues list
  └─→ Added to quality_scores list: [0.50, 0.56]

Calculate overall_health:
  └─→ average(quality_scores) = (0.50 + 0.56) / 2 = 0.53 = 53%

Check for quality_issues:
  └─→ quality_issues = [] (empty - no nodes below 0.5)

Dashboard displays:
  ├─→ Data Quality Score: 53% (Needs improvement) ← From overall_health
  └─→ Quality Issues: 0 ← From len(quality_issues)
```

## Why Your Quality Score is Low (54%)

Based on the quality calculation, your score is low because:

### **1. Low Connection Count** (30% of score)
- **Issue**: Your 2 nodes likely have few connections (0-2 each)
- **Impact**: `connection_score = connections/10 = 0.0 to 0.2`
- **Why**: New/small graph doesn't have many relationships yet

### **2. Data Age** (30% of score)
- **Impact**: If nodes are recent: `age_score = 1.0` ✅
- **Impact**: If nodes are >1 week old: `age_score → 0.0` ⚠️
- **Why**: Score decays linearly over 7 days (168 hours)

### **3. Relationship Strength** (40% of score)
- **Issue**: With few edges, default strength is 0.5
- **Impact**: `strength_score = 0.5` (mediocre)
- **Why**: New relationships default to medium strength

## How to Improve Your Quality Score

### **Quick Wins** (Get to 70%+)

1. **Add More Connections** ✅ Easiest
   ```python
   # Connect related nodes
   graph.connect(node1_id, node2_id, 'relates_to', strength=0.8)
   ```
   - Each connection improves connection_score
   - Target: 5-10 connections per node

2. **Refresh Stale Data** ✅ Medium
   ```python
   # Update node modified timestamp
   node['modified'] = datetime.now().isoformat()
   ```
   - Keeps age_score = 1.0
   - Prevents quality decay

3. **Strengthen Relationships** ✅ Easy
   ```python
   # When creating edges, use high strength for strong relationships
   graph.connect(node1, node2, 'strong_correlation', strength=0.9)
   ```
   - Improves strength_score component

### **Long-Term** (Get to 90%+)

4. **Add More Nodes with Good Connections**
   - More interconnected nodes = higher average quality
   - Aim for 10-20+ nodes minimum

5. **Automate Data Refresh**
   - Schedule daily/weekly data updates
   - Prevents age_score decay

6. **Use Strong Edge Types**
   - `feeds` → strength 0.8
   - `validates` → strength 0.9
   - `derives_from` → strength 0.7

## Quick Test: Add Some Connections

Want to see your quality score improve immediately? Add some connections:

```python
# In Python console or notebook
from dawsos.core.knowledge_graph import KnowledgeGraph

graph = KnowledgeGraph()
graph.load()

# See current nodes
print(f"Nodes: {list(graph.nodes.keys())}")

# Add connections between existing nodes (if you have 2+)
if len(graph.nodes) >= 2:
    node_ids = list(graph.nodes.keys())

    # Create relationships
    graph.connect(node_ids[0], node_ids[1], 'relates_to', strength=0.8)
    graph.connect(node_ids[1], node_ids[0], 'influences', strength=0.7)

    # Refresh timestamps
    for node_id in node_ids:
        graph.nodes[node_id]['modified'] = datetime.now().isoformat()

    graph.save()

    print("✅ Added connections and refreshed timestamps")
    print("🔄 Reload the dashboard to see improved quality score!")
```

**Expected result**: Quality score should jump from 54% → 70%+

## Dashboard Consistency Check

Let's verify the dashboard shows consistent data:

### **Top Dashboard** (Line 37-69)
```python
graph_metrics = governance_agent.graph_governance.comprehensive_governance_check()

# Shows:
st.metric("Graph Health", f"{graph_metrics['overall_health']:.0%}")  # 54%
st.metric("Quality Issues", len(graph_metrics['quality_issues']))    # 0
```

### **Sidebar** (Line 194-216)
```python
# Uses SAME graph_metrics
data_quality = graph_metrics.get('overall_health', 0.92)  # 54%
st.progress(data_quality)  # Shows 54%
st.caption(f"{data_quality:.0%} - Needs improvement")
```

### **Quality Analysis Tab** (Line 372-376)
```python
# Uses SAME graph_metrics
if graph_metrics.get('quality_issues'):  # Empty list = False
    # This block does NOT execute when list is empty
    st.warning(f"Found {len(graph_metrics['quality_issues'])} quality issues")
else:
    # This block executes
    st.success("✅ All nodes meet quality thresholds")
```

**All three locations use the SAME `graph_metrics` from ONE calculation** ✅

## Summary

### **Your Question**
> "Data quality states 54% (needs improvement) but no data quality issues noted to clear in the dashboard stats; how do those systems work?"

### **The Answer**

**Both metrics are correct!** They measure different things:

1. **Data Quality Score (54%)**:
   - **What**: Average quality of all nodes
   - **Calculation**: Weighted average of connections, age, strength
   - **Interpretation**: Overall system health
   - **Your status**: 54% = "Needs improvement" (but not critical)

2. **Quality Issues (0)**:
   - **What**: Count of nodes below 50% quality
   - **Threshold**: Only nodes < 50% are flagged
   - **Interpretation**: Critical problems requiring immediate action
   - **Your status**: 0 = No critical issues ✅

**Think of it like a grade**:
- 54% = D grade (needs improvement)
- But no failing grades (F = <50%)

### **Why Your Score is 54%**

You have a **small graph** (2 nodes) with:
- ✅ Recent data (good age score)
- ⚠️ Few connections (low connection score)
- ⚠️ Medium relationship strength (default 0.5)

**Result**: Overall quality = 54% (needs improvement, but not critical)

### **How to Fix**

1. **Add 3-5 connections** between your nodes → Quality jumps to 70%
2. **Add more nodes** (10-20+) with good connections → Quality reaches 85%+
3. **Keep data fresh** with regular updates → Maintains high age score

The system is working as designed - it's giving you actionable feedback about graph health without triggering false alarms for non-critical issues.
