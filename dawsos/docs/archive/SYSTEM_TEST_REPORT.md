- Graph-based knowledge persistence
- Predictive forecasting with confidence scoring
- Multi-agent orchestration

## Test Results by Component

### 1. Natural Language Understanding ✅
**Status:** FULLY OPERATIONAL
- **Intent Recognition:** 100% accuracy across all test cases
- **Entity Extraction:** Successfully identifying stocks, indicators, and concepts
- **Action Mapping:** Correctly translating intents to system actions

**Test Cases:**
- "What's Apple's stock price?" → QUERY intent, fetches AAPL
- "How will inflation affect tech stocks?" → FORECAST intent, analyzes relationships
- "Add Tesla to the graph" → ADD_DATA intent, creates node
- "Show me market patterns" → ANALYZE intent, pattern discovery
- "What's the current GDP?" → QUERY intent, fetches economic data

### 2. Data Integration ✅
**Status:** ALL APIS CONNECTED

**FRED API:**
- GDP: $30,485.729 billion (April 2025)
- CPI: 323.364
- Unemployment: 4.3%
- Federal Rate: 4.33%

**Financial Modeling Prep:**
- AAPL: $255.99 (+0.53%)
- Real-time quotes working
- Full market data available

### 3. Knowledge Graph ✅
**Status:** FULLY FUNCTIONAL
- **Node Creation:** Creating entities successfully
- **Edge Creation:** Establishing relationships
- **Persistence:** Save/load operations working
- **Graph Stats:** 3 nodes, 2 edges maintained across sessions

### 4. Pattern Discovery ✅
**Status:** OPERATIONAL
- Pattern spotter active
- Requires more data for complex patterns
- Transitive relationship detection working

### 5. Forecasting Engine ✅
**Status:** MAKING PREDICTIONS
- **AAPL Forecast:** Bearish signal (24% confidence)
- **Multi-influence:** Tracking GDP and CPI effects
- **Path Tracing:** Shows reasoning through graph

### 6. Agent Orchestration ✅
**Status:** 9 AGENTS COORDINATING
- Claude (NLU)

   - Economic indicators (FRED)
   - Market relationships
   - Pattern identification

3. **Intelligent Forecasting**
   - Multi-factor influence calculation
   - Confidence scoring
   - Path-based reasoning
   - Relationship weighting

4. **Self-Building**
   - Agents can delegate to Claude
   - CodeMonkey can write new code
