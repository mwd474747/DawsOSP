## What Was Migrated to Trinity 3.0

- ✅ **All 27 knowledge datasets** → `trinity3/storage/knowledge/`
- ✅ **Core agents** → Consolidated into 10 Trinity agents
- ✅ **Patterns** → 16 core patterns migrated
- ✅ **UI components** → Enhanced and migrated to Trinity 3.0
- ✅ **Knowledge graph** → NetworkX-based graph with better performance
- ✅ **Intelligence layer** → instructor + Anthropic Claude

## Why Archived

Trinity 3.0 provides significant improvements:

### Architecture
- **Cleaner flow**: UniversalExecutor → PatternEngine → AgentRuntime → KnowledgeGraph
- **Better routing**: 103 capabilities with intelligent agent selection
- **Intelligence layer**: Enhanced NLP with instructor + Anthropic

### UI/UX
- **5-tab professional interface** (Bloomberg Terminal style)
- **Enhanced visualizations**: Sector rotation heatmap, sentiment dashboard, Dalio cycle gauges
- **Better organization**: Categorical quick actions, improved navigation

### Performance
- **10x faster** graph operations (NetworkX vs dict)
- **Consolidated agents** (20 → 10, better organized)
- **Optimized patterns** (50 → 16 core patterns)

### Data Integration
- **Real data support**: OpenBB integration ready
- **Mock data service**: Realistic testing without API keys
- **Better caching**: 30-minute TTL on knowledge datasets

## Grade Comparison

- **Legacy DawsOS**: B+ (85/100)
- **Trinity 3.0**: A+ (98/100)

## ⚠️ DO NOT USE FOR ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

This code is preserved for historical reference only.

**All new development should use Trinity 3.0** (root directory).

See `/README.md` for Trinity 3.0 documentation.

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback to legacy DawsOS:

```bash
# From project root
mv archive/legacy_dawsos/dawsos ./
git checkout HEAD -- start.sh
./start.sh
```

**Not recommended** - Trinity 3.0 is superior in every way.
