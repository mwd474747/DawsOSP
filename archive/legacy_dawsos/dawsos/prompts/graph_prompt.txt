KNOWLEDGE GRAPH OPERATIONS GUIDE

The knowledge graph is your central intelligence repository. Here's how to work with it effectively:

NODE CREATION:
Nodes represent entities with types and data:
{"action": "add_node", "type": "indicator", "id": "CPI_2024", "data": {"value": 3.2, "date": "2024-01"}}
{"action": "add_node", "type": "stock", "id": "AAPL", "data": {"ticker": "AAPL", "sector": "technology"}}
{"action": "add_node", "type": "event", "id": "FED_MEETING_2024Q1", "data": {"date": "2024-03-20", "outcome": "hold"}}

EDGE CREATION:
Edges represent relationships with types and strengths (0-1):
{"action": "connect", "from": "FED_RATE", "to": "TECH_SECTOR", "relationship": "pressures", "strength": 0.8}
{"action": "connect", "from": "CPI", "to": "FED_RATE", "relationship": "causes", "strength": 0.6}
{"action": "connect", "from": "AAPL", "to": "TECH_SECTOR", "relationship": "part_of", "strength": 1.0}

PATTERN EXAMPLES:

1. Inflation → Tech Impact Chain:
   CPI -(causes:0.7)→ FED_RATE -(pressures:0.8)→ TECH_VALUATIONS -(affects:0.9)→ AAPL

2. Sector Correlation Web:
   TECH_SECTOR ←(correlates:0.8)→ GROWTH_STOCKS
   TECH_SECTOR ←(inverse:0.6)→ VALUE_STOCKS
   
3. Economic Regime Detection:
   GDP -(supports:0.7)→ BULL_MARKET
   INFLATION -(pressures:0.8)→ BULL_MARKET
   Result: Mixed signals suggest transitional regime

FORECASTING LOGIC:
To forecast a node's future:
1. Find all paths leading to the node
2. Calculate path strength (multiply edge strengths)
3. Sum positive influences (causes, supports, correlates)
4. Sum negative influences (pressures, weakens, inverse)
5. Net signal = (positive - negative) / total_weight
6. Confidence = min(total_connections / 5, 1.0)

QUERY PATTERNS:
{"action": "query", "pattern": {"type": "stock", "data": {"sector": "technology"}}}
{"action": "query", "pattern": {"type": "indicator", "has_connection_to": "FED_RATE"}}

COMMON GRAPH STRUCTURES:

Economic Web:
- GDP → Employment → Consumer_Spending → Corporate_Earnings
- Inflation → Fed_Rate → Bond_Yields → Stock_Valuations

Sector Relations:
- Stock -(part_of)→ Sector
- Sector -(correlates)→ Index
- Index -(depends_on)→ Economic_Indicator

Risk Connections:
- Portfolio -(contains)→ Stocks
- Stocks -(correlates)→ Other_Stocks
- All_Stocks -(affected_by)→ Macro_Factors

BEST PRACTICES:
1. Use strong relationships (>0.7) for direct causation
2. Use moderate relationships (0.4-0.7) for influence
3. Use weak relationships (<0.4) for loose correlation
4. Create nodes for recurring concepts to build memory
5. Connect new information to existing nodes when possible
6. Let patterns emerge from connections rather than forcing them
