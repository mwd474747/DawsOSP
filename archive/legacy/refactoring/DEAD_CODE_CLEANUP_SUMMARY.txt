DEAD CODE VALIDATION - AGENT 3 COMPLETE
========================================

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED - Conservative Cleanup

FILES REMOVED: 3
- fix_all_legacy_routing.py (245 lines)
- fix_legacy_params.py (78 lines)  
- fix_metadata.py (71 lines)
Total: ~394 lines of dead code removed

VALIDATION PASSED:
✓ Pattern linter: 48 patterns, 0 errors
✓ Syntax check: All core modules compile
✓ Import check: No broken imports
✓ Git check: All removed files were untracked

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT STEPS:
1. Move test_capability_routing.py → dawsos/tests/validation/
2. Move test_options_flow_complete.py → dawsos/tests/validation/
3. Archive migrate_patterns_bulk.py → scripts/archive/

FILES ANALYZED BUT KEPT:
- analyze_patterns.py (utility - still useful)
- analyze_refactoring_opportunities.py (utility - still useful)
- intelligence_display_examples.py (examples - intentional)

CONSERVATIVE APPROACH:
- Only removed untracked files with 100% certainty
- Did NOT touch tracked files (safer to relocate than delete)
- Did NOT remove files with uncertain usage
- Did NOT attempt function-level cleanup (high false positive risk)

IMPACT:
- Risk: MINIMAL
- Codebase reduction: ~400 lines
- Test status: ALL PASS ✓
