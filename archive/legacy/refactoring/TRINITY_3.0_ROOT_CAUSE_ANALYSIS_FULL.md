# Trinity 3.0 Root Cause Analysis - Why Violations Occurred

**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Status**: üîç Root cause identified + Fix plan ready

## Executive Summary

Trinity 3.0 violations occurred due to **capability metadata mismatch** between AGENT_CAPABILITIES (strings) and agent.capabilities (objects). When capability routing silently failed, developers created direct agent calls as workarounds.

**Root Cause**: `AgentAdapter.get_capabilities()` returns runtime capability objects instead of metadata capability strings, causing `find_capable_agent()` to never find matches.

**Fix Time**: ~2 hours  
**Risk**: Low

## The Complete Picture

See TRINITY_3.0_ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md for full details.

**Fix Plan**: 
1. Store metadata capabilities separately in AgentAdapter  
2. Fix get_capabilities() to return metadata  
3. Update find_capable_agent() logic  
4. Replace direct agent calls with capability routing  
5. Add capability routing tests

**Status**: Ready for implementation
