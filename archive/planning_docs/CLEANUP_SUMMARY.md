## What Was Removed

**Nothing was deleted** - only moved to archive.

All technical debt documentation is preserved in `archive/legacy/technical_debt/` for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding design decisions
- Avoiding regression of known issues
- Learning from past problems

---

## Next Steps

### Week 1 (Starting Now)

**Day 1-2**: Entity Extraction
- Copy `dawsos/core/entity_extractor.py` → `trinity3/intelligence/`
- Test with 20 example queries
- Verify Instructor + Anthropic integration

**Day 3-4**: Conversation Memory
- Copy `dawsos/core/conversation_memory.py` → `trinity3/intelligence/`
- Test reference resolution ("it", "that stock", "compare")
- Add session persistence

**Day 5**: Enhanced Chat Processor
- Copy `dawsos/core/enhanced_chat_processor.py` → `trinity3/intelligence/`
- Wire to entity_extractor + conversation_memory
- Test intent-to-pattern routing

**Deliverable**: Natural language understanding working in Trinity 3.0

---

## Success Metrics

### Week 1 Exit Criteria
- [ ] Entity extraction working (20+ test queries)
- [ ] Conversation memory resolves references
- [ ] Enhanced chat processor routes to patterns
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] `MIGRATION_STATUS.md` updated to Week 1 complete

---

## Rollback Plan

If migration encounters critical issues:

1. Trinity 3.0 source files preserved in `trinity3/`
2. DawsOS 2.0 source files preserved in `dawsos/`
3. Can run either system independently
4. No files deleted, only archived
5. Full history in `archive/legacy/`

**Risk**: Low - Both systems remain intact

## Questions?

- **Migration plan**: See `trinity3/MIGRATION_PLAN.md`
- **Source files**: See `trinity3/MIGRATION_SOURCES.md`
- **Weekly progress**: See `MIGRATION_STATUS.md`
- **Historical context**: See `archive/legacy/technical_debt/`

---

**Status**: Repository cleaned and ready for Week 1 migration
**Confidence**: High - All source files verified intact
**Next Action**: Begin Week 1, Day 1 - Entity Extraction
