# Final Assessment & Recommendations — Post-Restoration Update (2025-10-26)

**Summary**: The aggressive documentation cleanup has been fully remediated. Core guides (README, PRODUCT_SPEC, DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE) now reflect the ScenarioService, ratings rubrics, and provider transforms that actually ship. Remaining work centers on (1) restoring an explicit testing guide, (2) wiring ScenarioService/DaR persistence, (3) implementing optimizer/reporting deliverables, and (4) keeping archived inventories clearly labeled.

## Findings (Ordered by Priority)

1. **Testing Guide Missing (P1-DOCS)**  
   - Status: Not yet recreated after Trinity cleanup.  
   - Recommendation: Draft `TESTING_GUIDE.md` that documents pytest targets, integration scripts, and how to seed data for scenario tests. Track under `.ops/TASK_INVENTORY_2025-10-24.md` (Docs column).

2. **Scenario/DaR Persistence Gap (P1-CODE)**  
   - Status: ScenarioService + MacroHound run seeded shocks/DaR, but results stay in-memory.  
   - Recommendation: Implement `scenario_results` + `dar_history` tables, persist runs from `/v1/execute`, and surface them in Streamlit. See `.ops/SHORTCUT_REMEDIATION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` Part 2.

3. **Optimizer + Reporting Still Planned (P1-CODE / P1-DOCS)**  
   - Status: `backend/app/services/optimizer.py` exists and PDF rights gates run, yet no UI wiring or WeasyPrint output is available.  
   - Recommendation: Prioritize `policy_rebalance` integration and WeasyPrint export implementation once Scenario/DaR persistence lands.

4. **Archive Hygiene**  
   - Status: `.ops/TASK_INVENTORY_2025-10-26.md` can mislead if read without context.  
   - Recommendation: Keep the new “Archive” notice at the top of the file and continue pointing reviewers to `.ops/TASK_INVENTORY_2025-10-24.md` as the living backlog.

## Closing Notes

- Commits `5d24e04`, `8fd4d9e`, `e5cf939`, `fa8bcf8`, `72de052`, `2876d86`, `bc6a7ee`, and `5e28827` collectively resolved the P0 shortcuts cited in the earlier audit. `.ops/SHORTCUT_REMEDIATION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` has been updated to mark these items complete.
- CLAUDE agent docs now include explicit status callouts so new assistants immediately know which services are operational vs planned.
- Keep this file as the final state of the remediation review; future governance checks should open a fresh document rather than editing this archive.
