2. **Week 1-2**: Use trinity3_intelligence_specialist.md for intelligence layer
3. **Week 2-9**: Use trinity3_pattern_specialist.md for patterns
4. **Week 4-5**: Use trinity3_data_specialist.md for OpenBB integration
5. **Week 3, 10**: Use trinity3_agent_specialist.md for agent system
6. **Week 7-8**: Use trinity3_ui_specialist.md for UI
7. **Week 12**: Validate all production launch criteria before launch

## Impact

**Before (DawsOS 2.0)**:
- Agents described legacy system with technical debt
- Mixed Trinity 1.0 and 2.0 concepts
- No clear production standards
- Emojis in UI
- Mock data in some services

**After (Trinity 3.0)**:
- Agents describe production-ready system
- Clear Trinity 3.0 execution flow with intelligence layer
- Measurable production launch criteria
- NO emojis (professional Bloomberg aesthetic)
- Zero mock data (100% real OpenBB/FRED)

**Documentation Strategy**:
- Core agents (trinity_architect, pattern_specialist, knowledge_curator, agent_orchestrator): Concise with references
- Migration specialists: Detailed implementation with day-by-day breakdowns
- Total reduction: ~1,500 lines across core agents (reduced duplication)
- Total addition: 3,616 lines in migration specialists (added detail where needed)

---

**Result**: Claude agents now accurately reflect Trinity 3.0 production architecture and guide developers through 12-week migration to launch-ready system with natural language understanding, real data, capability-based routing, and Bloomberg-quality UI.
