## YOUR MISSION

Guide Trinity/DawsOS from 60% vision alignment to 95% in 6 weeks by executing the Transparency-First Roadmap.

**Product Vision**: Transparent Intelligence Platform with Portfolio Management
- Layer 1: Beautiful Market & Economic Dashboards (Bloomberg-grade)
- Layer 2: Transparent Conversational Intelligence (show HOW decisions are made) ← **THE differentiator**
- Layer 3: Portfolio-Centric Analysis (contextual intelligence)
- Integration: Dashboard ↔ Chat ↔ Portfolio (everything talks to everything)

## VERIFIED CURRENT STATE (Post-Audit Oct 21, 2025)

**Project Inventory**:
- **7 agents** (2 registered: financial_analyst, claude | 4 available: data_harvester, forecast_dreamer, graph_mind, pattern_spotter)
- **16 patterns** (economy: 6, smart: 7, workflows: 3)
- **27 knowledge datasets** ✅
- **13 core modules** + 24 actions/
- **7 UI components**
- **4 services** (all active)

**Completed Fixes** ✅:
- use_real_data=True (core/actions/execute_through_registry.py:57) - ALL patterns use real data
- Empty directories deleted (patterns/analysis/, intelligence/schemas/)

**Remaining Issues** ⚠️:
- Legacy path references (core/universal_executor.py) - 15 min fix
- Only 2/7 agents registered (main.py) - 15 min fix
- Execution trace not in UI - Week 1 build
- Portfolio features missing - Week 2 build

## WEEK-BY-WEEK EXECUTION PLAN

### WEEK 1: Transparency + Real Data (YOUR CURRENT FOCUS)

**Goal**: Make intelligence layer TRANSPARENT and verify real data

**Day 1** (4 hours):
- [ ] Remove dawsos/ path references (core/universal_executor.py lines 94-98)
- [ ] Register 4 agents (main.py after line 90)
- [ ] Test all 16 patterns with real data
- [ ] Verify dashboards show real market data (FRED, OpenBB, yfinance)

**Day 2-3** (2 days):
- [ ] Create ui/execution_trace_panel.py
  ```python
  # Display: Pattern → Agent → Capability → Data Source chain
  # Show confidence scores
  # Add "Explain this step" buttons
  ```
- [ ] Integrate into main.py chat panel
- [ ] Test: Every pattern shows full execution trace

**Day 4** (1 day):
- [ ] Add "Explain" button to all dashboard charts
- [ ] onClick → open_chat_with_context(pattern_id, chart_data)
- [ ] Test: Economic Dashboard → Click chart → Chat explains with trace

**Day 5** (1 day):
- [ ] User journey testing: Dashboard → Click → Explain → See trace
- [ ] Performance: <2s trace display
- [ ] Document: What works, what needs polish

**Deliverable**: Transparent execution visible in chat, real data flowing, click-to-explain working

---

### WEEK 2: Portfolio Foundation

**Goal**: Get portfolio upload + overlay working

**Day 1-2** (2 days):
- [ ] Create core/portfolio_manager.py (add_position, remove_position, get_holdings, calculate_total_value)
- [ ] Storage: storage/portfolios/{portfolio_id}.json
- [ ] Integrate with KnowledgeGraph

**Day 3** (1 day):
- [ ] Create ui/portfolio_upload.py (CSV upload + manual entry)

**Day 4** (1 day):
- [ ] Create ui/portfolio_dashboard.py (holdings table, charts, risk panel)

**Day 5** (1 day):
- [ ] Portfolio overlay on existing dashboards
- [ ] Portfolio-aware chat

**Deliverable**: Upload portfolio → See on dashboard → Chat knows about it

---

### WEEK 3: Pattern Restoration + Integration

**Goal**: Restore 11 critical patterns, enhance integration

**Day 1-2** (2 days):
- [ ] Restore 8 analysis/ patterns from git
- [ ] Restore 2 system/ patterns from git
- [ ] Restore 1 market/ pattern from git

**Day 3-4** (2 days):
- [ ] Dashboard enhancement (mini-charts in chat, dashboard links)
- [ ] Click holding → Full analysis modal

**Day 5** (1 day):
- [ ] Integration testing (27 patterns, dashboard-chat-portfolio flow)

**Deliverable**: 27 patterns operational, full integration

---

### WEEKS 4-6: Advanced Features

**Week 4**: Custom rating systems (dividend safety, moat strength, recession resilience)
**Week 5**: News impact + alert system
**Week 6**: Advanced analytics (factor exposure, correlation, performance attribution)

---

## EXECUTION GUIDELINES

### Before Starting Any Task

**Read**:
1. [FINAL_CONSOLIDATED_STATE.md](../FINAL_CONSOLIDATED_STATE.md) - Current state & execution plan
2. [MASTER_TASK_LIST.md](../MASTER_TASK_LIST.md) - Single source of truth
3. [TRINITY_PRODUCT_VISION_REFINED.md](../TRINITY_PRODUCT_VISION_REFINED.md) - Product vision
4. [PROJECT_STATE_AUDIT.md](../PROJECT_STATE_AUDIT.md) - Complete inventory

**Verify**:
- Current state matches documentation
- Task is in Week 1-6 plan
- All prerequisites complete

### During Task Execution

**Follow Architecture**:
```
User Query → EnhancedChatProcessor → EntityExtraction →
  UniversalExecutor → PatternEngine → AgentRuntime →
    Agent (via capability) → Data (OpenBB/FRED/yfinance) →
      KnowledgeGraph (store)
```

**Enforce Rules**:
- use_real_data = True (ALWAYS)
- Capability-based routing (not agent names)
- Knowledge graph storage (all results)
- Transparency display (execution trace visible)

**Test Everything**:
- Unit test new components
- Integration test full flow
- Performance test (<2s response)
- User journey test (end-to-end)

### After Task Completion

**Update**:
- [ ] Mark task complete in MASTER_TASK_LIST.md
- [ ] Update FINAL_CONSOLIDATED_STATE.md if state changed
- [ ] Document issues encountered
- [ ] Commit with clear message

**Verify**:
- Application still launches
- All dashboards still render
- No regressions introduced
- Documentation accurate

---

## TRANSPARENCY IS THE CORE

**Remember**: Trinity is NOT just a portfolio tracker or stock research tool.

**Trinity IS**: A platform where users UNDERSTAND how intelligence works:
- See pattern execution: "I'm using buffett_checklist.json..."
- See agent routing: "Routing to financial_analyst for can_calculate_dcf..."
- See data sources: "Using FRED for CPI (9.2/10 confidence, fresh from API)..."
- See calculations: Click step → See raw data → Verify math

**Every task must preserve or enhance transparency.**

---

## COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

**❌ Don't**:
- Use mock data (use_real_data=True enforced)
- Bypass execution flow (always use UniversalExecutor)
- Reference deleted directories (dawsos/, trinity3/)
- Create new planning docs (use MASTER_TASK_LIST.md)
- Hardcode agent names (use capability routing)
- Hide reasoning (always show execution trace)

**✅ Do**:
- Follow architecture (UniversalExecutor → PatternEngine → AgentRuntime)
- Use capabilities (can_calculate_dcf, not "financial_analyst")
- Store in knowledge graph (all results persisted)
- Show transparency (execution trace, confidence, sources)
- Test end-to-end (user journey validation)
- Update docs (keep MASTER_TASK_LIST.md current)

---

## WEEK 1 DAY 1 QUICK START

**Execute Now** (1-2 hours):

1. **Remove dawsos/ path references**:
```python
# core/universal_executor.py lines 94-98
# DELETE these lines:
if not meta_pattern_dir.exists():
    meta_pattern_dir = Path('dawsos/patterns/system/meta')
```

2. **Register 4 agents**:
```python
# main.py after line 90, add:
from agents.data_harvester import DataHarvester
dh = DataHarvester()
self.runtime.register_agent('data_harvester', dh, {'capabilities': [...]})
# ... repeat for forecast_dreamer, graph_mind, pattern_spotter
```

3. **Test**:
```bash
venv/bin/python -c "from core.pattern_engine import PatternEngine; engine = PatternEngine(); print(f'Patterns: {len(engine.patterns)}')"
venv/bin/streamlit run main.py --server.port=8501
# Verify: All 4 dashboards render with real data
```

**Then**: Begin Day 2 transparency UI build
