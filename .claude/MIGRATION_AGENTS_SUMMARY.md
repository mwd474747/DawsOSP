## Key Features Across All Specialists

### 1. Day-by-Day Breakdown
Every specialist provides granular daily tasks for their assigned weeks:
- Day 1: Setup and prerequisites
- Day 2-4: Core implementation
- Day 5: Testing and validation

### 2. Code Examples
All specialists include working code examples:
- Complete class structures
- Method implementations
- Test suites with expected outputs
- Before/after comparisons for fixes

### 3. Success Criteria
Every phase has clear, measurable exit criteria:

- Cache hit rate: 95%+
- Response time: < 2s
- Zero mock data (grep verified)
- NO EMOJIS (design requirement)

### 4. Common Issues & Solutions
Each specialist documents common pitfalls:
- Intelligence: API rate limits → exponential backoff
- Pattern: Template fields not resolving → validation
- Data: OpenBB rate limiting → increase cache TTL
- Agent: Capability not found → check registry
- UI: Emojis appearing → grep search and remove

### 5. Resources
All specialists link to relevant documentation:
- Source files to port (with line numbers)
- Related guides (PATTERN_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md, etc.)
- External docs (OpenBB, Streamlit)
- DawsOS 2.0 reference implementations

## Simulation-Driven Design

These agents were created after simulating the migration work:

**Simulation Process**:
1. Examined actual source files (entity_extractor.py 406 lines, pattern_engine.py 2,291 lines)
2. Counted dependencies (24 action files required for pattern engine)
3. Identified complexity (deep_dive.json has 80-line template with 15+ nested fields)
4. Discovered hidden work (OpenBB adapter needed for 103 capabilities)
5. Extended timeline from 10 to 12 weeks based on simulation

**Result**: Realistic, detailed instructions based on actual code complexity, not optimistic estimates.
