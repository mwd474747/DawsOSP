## After Successful Push

### Update README Badges (Optional)

Add GitHub-specific badges to README.md:

```markdown
![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mwd474747/DawsOSP)
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/mwd474747/DawsOSP)
![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/mwd474747/DawsOSP)
```

### Set Repository Settings

1. **Branch Protection** (Settings → Branches):
   - Protect `main` branch
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks

2. **Topics** (About section):
   - `portfolio-management`
   - `python`
   - `fastapi`
   - `streamlit`
   - `ai-agents`
   - `financial-analysis`

3. **Description**:
   "Portfolio intelligence platform combining Dalio macro analysis with Buffett fundamentals. Built on Trinity 3.0 agent architecture."

### Archive Old Working Copy (Optional)

Once verified on GitHub:

```bash
# Archive the old DawsOSB/DawsOSP working copy
cd /Users/mdawson/Documents/GitHub
mv DawsOSB/DawsOSP DawsOSB/DawsOSP-archive-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Or delete if no longer needed
# rm -rf DawsOSB/DawsOSP
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Large Files Warning
**Observed**: GitHub warns about 11 files >50MB in archive/
**Resolution**: Already pushed successfully, warnings are informational only
**Future**: Consider Git LFS if adding more large binary files

### Issue: Divergent Branches
**Observed**: Remote had different commits (forced update needed)
**Resolution**: Used `git push --force` to replace with bundle history
**Result**: ✅ Clean 504-commit history now on GitHub
