## After Successful Push

### Update README Badges (Optional)

Add GitHub-specific badges to README.md:

```markdown
![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/MikeDawg1/DawsOSP)
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/MikeDawg1/DawsOSP)
![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/MikeDawg1/DawsOSP)
```

### Set Repository Settings

1. **Branch Protection** (Settings → Branches):
   - Protect `main` branch
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks

2. **Topics** (About section):
   - `portfolio-management`
   - `python`
   - `fastapi`
   - `streamlit`
   - `ai-agents`
   - `financial-analysis`

3. **Description**:
   "Portfolio intelligence platform combining Dalio macro analysis with Buffett fundamentals. Built on Trinity 3.0 agent architecture."

### Archive Old Working Copy (Optional)

Once verified on GitHub:

```bash
# Archive the old DawsOSB/DawsOSP working copy
cd /Users/mdawson/Documents/GitHub
mv DawsOSB/DawsOSP DawsOSB/DawsOSP-archive-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Or delete if no longer needed
# rm -rf DawsOSB/DawsOSP
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Repository not found"
**Cause**: GitHub repository hasn't been created yet
**Fix**: Complete Step 1 above

### Error: "Authentication failed"
**Cause**: HTTPS credentials not configured
**Fix**: Use SSH method or configure Git credentials:
```bash
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
```

### Error: "Updates were rejected"
**Cause**: Remote has commits not in local
**Fix**: This shouldn't happen with a new empty repo, but if it does:
```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
git push -u origin main
```
