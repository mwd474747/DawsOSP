# Development Simulation & Gap Analysis
**Date**: October 21, 2025
**Purpose**: Simulate 8-week development, identify gaps, missed opportunities, hidden dependencies
**Methodology**: Week-by-week simulation with realistic blockers and edge cases

---

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Critical Findings
After simulating the 8-week Foundation+ roadmap development:

**GRADE: B- (Solid plan with 12 critical gaps + 8 missed opportunities)**

**The Good** (What's Well-Planned):
- ‚úÖ Individual investor focus is clear and defensible
- ‚úÖ Week-by-week sequencing is logical (foundations ‚Üí features)
- ‚úÖ User personas are realistic and well-researched
- ‚úÖ 8 weeks is achievable scope (not over-ambitious)

**The Gaps** (What's Missing or Underestimated):
- üî¥ **12 Critical Gaps** that WILL block development
- üü° **8 Missed Opportunities** that reduce competitive advantage
- üü† **15 Hidden Dependencies** not mentioned in roadmap
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Timeline Risk**: Realistic completion is 10-11 weeks (not 8)

**Recommendation**: Add **Pre-Week 0 (5 days)** + Extend to **10-week roadmap**

---

## üö® CRITICAL GAPS (Will Block Development)

### Gap 1: No CSV Format Specification (CRITICAL - Week 0 Blocker)
**Discovery**: Week 0 Day 2 simulation

**Problem**:
-Roadmap says: "Support Questrade CSV, Interactive Brokers CSV, Generic CSV"
- Reality: Each broker has 3-5 different CSV export formats
- Example: Questrade has "Activity Report", "Account Activity", "Detailed Activity", "Trade Confirmation" formats
- **None of these map cleanly to Beancount ledger**

**What the Roadmap Missed**:
```python
# Questrade "Activity Report" (Format A):
# Date, Settlement Date, Action, Symbol, Description, Quantity, Price, Gross Amount, Commission, Net Amount, Currency, Account #

# Questrade "Account Activity" (Format B):
# Transaction Date, Action, Symbol, Description, Quantity, Price, Gross Amount, Commission, Currency

# Interactive Brokers (Format C):
# Symbol, DateTime, Quantity, T. Price, Proceeds, Comm/Fee, Basis, Realized P/L, Code

# Generic (Mint/Personal Capital) (Format D):
# Date, Description, Original Description, Amount, Transaction Type, Category, Account Name
```

**Impact**:
- Week 0 Day 2 task "Implement CSV parser" is **5x more complex** than planned
- Need: CSV format detection, field mapping UI, validation, error handling
- **Blocker**: Without format detection, user uploads CSV ‚Üí Crashes

**Solution Required**:
- **Pre-Week 0**: Research & document all broker CSV formats (3 days)
- **Week 0 Day 2-3**: Implement robust CSV parser with format detection (2 days, not 1 day)
- **Add**: CSV upload wizard (preview, field mapping, validation)

**Estimated Delay**: +3 days (Pre-Week 0 required)

---

### Gap 2: Beancount Ledger Doesn't Store Multi-Currency FX Rates (CRITICAL - Week 0 Blocker)
**Discovery**: Week 0 Day 3 simulation

**Problem**:
- Beancount transaction:
```beancount
2025-10-15 * "Buy AAPL"
  Assets:Brokerage:AAPL   100 AAPL {150 USD}
  Assets:Brokerage:Cash  -15000 USD
```

- **Missing**: FX rate at trade time (if portfolio base currency is CAD)
- Beancount supports `@ 1.35 CAD` but this is **per-unit price conversion**, not FX rate metadata

**What the Roadmap Missed**:
- Beancount doesn't have "transaction-level FX rate metadata"
- Can add custom metadata: `fx_rate: "1.3500"`
- But: Beancount's built-in accounting doesn't use it
- **You need to manually calculate CAD amounts** in application code

**Impact**:
- Week 0 Day 3 integration task incomplete
- Week 2 Day 4 multi-currency attribution **cannot use Beancount FX rates** (doesn't exist)
- Need separate `fx_rates` database/file

**Solution Required**:
- Store FX rates in Beancount as custom metadata (parsing overhead)
- OR: Maintain separate `storage/fx_rates/YYYY-MM-DD.json` (simpler, preferred)
- **Week 0 Day 3**: Add FX rate storage alongside Beancount ledger

**Estimated Delay**: +1 day (FX rate infrastructure)

---

### Gap 3: Pricing Pack Service Requires Daily Scheduled Job (CRITICAL - Week 0 Missing)
**Discovery**: Week 0 Day 5 simulation

**Problem**:
- Roadmap says: "Create daily pricing pack generation (manual for now, automate later)"
- Reality: **Manual pricing pack generation is NOT viable for beta users**
- Users expect: "I upload CSV today, portfolio is valued as of today"
- Manual means: Developer runs script daily to create pricing packs
- **This breaks in beta** (users in different timezones, weekends, holidays)

**What the Roadmap Missed**:
- Need automated daily pricing pack generation from DAY 1
- Requires: Cron job or APScheduler (background task)
- Complexity: Fetch 500+ stock prices + FX rates daily at market close (4pm ET)
- **Weekend/holiday handling**: Markets closed, use last available pack

**Impact**:
- Beta users upload portfolio on Saturday ‚Üí No pricing pack available ‚Üí Portfolio valuation fails
- Week 8 beta launch blocked without automated pricing packs

**Solution Required**:
- **Week 0 Day 5**: Implement APScheduler background task
- **Task**: Daily 4:30pm ET ‚Üí Fetch prices (yfinance/FMP), FX rates (FRED), create pricing pack
- **Add**: `services/pricing_pack_scheduler.py`

**Estimated Delay**: +1 day (scheduler infrastructure)

---

### Gap 4: Macro Exposures Dataset Creation is 500+ Hours of Work (CRITICAL - Week 1 Blocker)
**Discovery**: Week 1 Day 2 simulation

**Problem**:
- Roadmap says: "Calculate macro exposures for 500+ stocks using historical regressions (10 years)"
- Reality: This is a **3-6 month research project**, not a 1-day task

**What the Roadmap Missed**:
- **Data collection**: 10 years of daily data for 500 stocks + macro indicators (Fed Funds, CPI, 10Y yield, USD index, oil, unemployment)
  - Source: yfinance (stocks), FRED (macro)
  - Download time: ~2 hours for 500 stocks √ó 10 years
  - Storage: ~500MB CSV files

- **Regression analysis**: 500 stocks √ó 5 macro factors = 2,500 regressions
  - Each regression: Load data ‚Üí Merge ‚Üí Calculate returns ‚Üí Regress ‚Üí Store beta
  - Computation time: ~5 min per stock = 2,500 minutes = **42 hours**

- **Validation**: Sanity check betas (Tech should have negative duration beta, Energy positive commodity beta)
  - Manual review: ~50 hours (spot-check 100 stocks, identify outliers)

- **Edge cases**:
  - IPOs (< 10 years of data) ‚Üí Use sector average beta
  - M&A/spinoffs (discontinuous data) ‚Üí Adjust or exclude
  - Penny stocks (illiquid, noisy data) ‚Üí Flag as low confidence

**Impact**:
- Week 1 Day 2 task is **impossible** in 1 day
- Without macro exposures dataset, Week 1-3 macro integration completely blocked
- **Macro integration is 40% of MVP value proposition**

**Solution Required**:
- **Option A (Preferred)**: Use pre-existing research
  - Source: Academic papers (Fama-French factors), Bloomberg betas, sector averages
  - Effort: 2-3 days to compile + validate
  - Coverage: S&P 500 (sufficient for beta)

- **Option B**: Calculate for top 100 stocks only (not 500)
  - Effort: ~8 hours computation + 4 hours validation = 2 days
  - Coverage: 80% of individual investor portfolios

- **Option C**: Defer precision, use sector proxies
  - Tech stocks ‚Üí Tech sector average beta
  - Effort: 1 day (100 stocks manually categorized)
  - Downside: Less accurate, but functional for beta

**Recommendation**: Option A (pre-existing research) ‚Üí 3 days

**Estimated Delay**: +2 days (Week 1 extends to 7 days)

---

### Gap 5: Causal KG Seeding Requires Domain Expertise (CRITICAL - Week 1 Blocker)
**Discovery**: Week 1 Day 4 simulation

**Problem**:
- Roadmap says: "Seed 100+ causal relationships: Macro ‚Üí Sector, Sector ‚Üí Company, Macro ‚Üí Company"
- Reality: **Creating causal relationships requires economic theory + empirical validation**

**What the Roadmap Missed**:
- **Example causal chain**: "Fed Rate ‚Üë ‚Üí Tech Valuation ‚Üì"
  - Intermediate steps: Fed Rate ‚Üí Treasury Yield ‚Üí Discount Rate ‚Üí Tech Valuation
  - Elasticities: 0.9, 1.0, -0.8
  - **How do you know elasticity is 0.9 vs 0.7?** (Requires regression analysis)

- **Domain knowledge required**:
  - Monetary policy transmission (Fed ‚Üí Yields ‚Üí Stocks)
  - Fiscal policy (Government spending ‚Üí GDP ‚Üí Sectors)
  - Commodity channels (Oil ‚Üí Energy profits, Input costs ‚Üí Margins)
  - FX channels (USD strength ‚Üí Exporters, Importers)
  - Labor market (Unemployment ‚Üí Consumer spending ‚Üí Retail)

- **Validation**:
  - Each causal edge needs evidence: "Historical correlation 0.85", "Research paper: XYZ"
  - Without evidence ‚Üí Causal KG is just "beliefs", not "knowledge"

**Impact**:
- Week 1 Day 4 task is **not achievable** in 1 day without domain expert
- Low-quality causal KG ‚Üí Users lose trust ("Why does this say Fed rate hike helps banks? That's wrong.")
- **Transparency differentiator fails** if causality is wrong

**Solution Required**:
- **Pre-Week 1**: Hire economist/quant consultant (1 week, $2K-5K)
  - Deliverable: 50 validated causal relationships with elasticities + evidence

- **OR**: Use simplified causal relationships without elasticities
  - Example: "Fed Rate ‚Üë ‚Üí Tech Sector ‚Üì" (directional only, no magnitude)
  - Effort: 1-2 days (developer can research)
  - Downside: Less sophisticated, but functional

**Recommendation**: Simplified causality for beta, hire expert post-PMF

**Estimated Delay**: +1 day (simplified approach)

---

### Gap 6: Pattern Chaining Requires PatternEngine Refactor (CRITICAL - Week 2 Blocker)
**Discovery**: Week 2 Day 3 simulation

**Problem**:
- Roadmap says: "Implement shared context: PatternContext stores intermediate results, Pattern A output ‚Üí Pattern B input"
- Reality: Current `PatternEngine` doesn't support this

**What the Roadmap Missed**:
- Current architecture (from CURRENT_STATE.md):
```python
# core/pattern_engine.py
class PatternEngine:
    def execute_pattern(self, pattern_id, context):
        pattern = self.patterns[pattern_id]
        for step in pattern['steps']:
            result = self.execute_step(step, context)
            # Each step is isolated, no shared state
        return result
```

- **Pattern chaining requires**:
  1. Shared context object (stores results from previous patterns)
  2. Pattern dependency graph (Pattern B depends on Pattern A)
  3. Execution order resolution (topological sort)
  4. Error propagation (if Pattern A fails, skip Pattern B)

**Impact**:
- Week 2 Day 3 task requires **refactoring core/pattern_engine.py**
- Refactor scope: ~300 lines, risk of breaking existing 16 patterns
- Testing: All 16 patterns need regression testing after refactor

**Solution Required**:
- **Pre-Week 2**: Design pattern chaining architecture (1 day)
- **Week 2 Day 3-4**: Implement + test refactor (2 days, not 1 day)
- **Week 2 Day 5**: Regression test all 16 patterns

**Estimated Delay**: +2 days (Week 2 extends to 7 days)

---

### Gap 7: Multi-Currency Requires FX Rate Data Source (CRITICAL - Week 2 Blocker)
**Discovery**: Week 2 Day 4 simulation

**Problem**:
- Roadmap says: "Integrate with FX data source (FRED or FMP)"
- Reality: **FRED doesn't have real-time FX rates, FMP has limited FX pairs**

**What the Roadmap Missed**:
- **FRED FX data**:
  - Daily rates (not real-time)
  - Limited pairs (USD/EUR, USD/GBP, USD/CAD, USD/JPY)
  - Missing: USD/CHF, USD/AUD, USD/NZD, USD/SGD (common for international investors)
  - **No WM/Reuters 4pm fixing** (industry standard for end-of-day FX)

- **FMP FX data**:
  - Real-time rates (good)
  - Pairs: 30+ (better than FRED)
  - **No historical WM/Reuters fixing** (for reproducibility)

- **What individual investors need**:
  - End-of-day FX rates (WM/Reuters 4pm London fixing)
  - Historical rates (for Beancount ledger with historical trades)
  - Coverage: USD/CAD, USD/EUR, USD/GBP (minimum), + USD/CHF, USD/AUD (nice-to-have)

**Impact**:
- Week 2 Day 4-5 multi-currency implementation **blocked without FX data source**
- Pricing packs incomplete without FX rates
- Week 0 pricing pack service **also blocked**

**Solution Required**:
- **Option A**: Use yfinance FX rates
  - Pairs: `USDCAD=X`, `EURUSD=X`, `GBPUSD=X`
  - Coverage: Good (30+ pairs)
  - Timing: Market close (not WM 4pm, but acceptable for beta)
  - Cost: Free

- **Option B**: Use FMP FX historical endpoint
  - Coverage: 30+ pairs
  - Historical: Yes
  - Cost: Free tier (250 requests/day, sufficient for beta)

- **Option C**: Use Alpha Vantage FX
  - Coverage: 180+ pairs
  - Historical: Yes
  - Cost: Free tier (25 requests/day, insufficient)

**Recommendation**: Option A (yfinance) + B (FMP) fallback

**Estimated Delay**: +1 day (FX integration + testing)

---

### Gap 8: Portfolio Tab Doesn't Exist (CRITICAL - Week 3 Blocker)
**Discovery**: Week 3 Day 1 simulation

**Problem**:
- Roadmap says: "Redesign Portfolio tab as PRIMARY dashboard"
- Reality: **There is NO Portfolio tab in current main.py**

**What the Roadmap Missed**:
- Current main.py (from CURRENT_STATE.md):
  - Tab 1: Market Overview
  - Tab 2: Economic Dashboard
  - Tab 3: Stock Analysis
  - Tab 4: Prediction Lab
  - **NO Portfolio tab**

- Week 3 assumes: "Enhance existing Portfolio tab"
- Reality: **Must CREATE Portfolio tab from scratch**

**Impact**:
- Week 3 Day 1-2 task scope is 3x larger than planned
- Not a redesign, but **net-new development**
- Includes: Holdings table, valuations, betas, charts, scenario widget

**Solution Required**:
- **Week 3 Day 1-3**: Create Portfolio tab (3 days, not 2 days)
  - Day 1: Holdings table with Beancount integration
  - Day 2: Macro betas columns + aggregate calculations
  - Day 3: Charts + scenario widget

**Estimated Delay**: +1 day (Week 3 extends to 6 days)

---

### Gap 9: Execution Trace Storage Not Defined (CRITICAL - Week 4 Blocker)
**Discovery**: Week 4 Day 2 simulation

**Problem**:
- Roadmap says: "Modify PatternEngine to record execution traces"
- Reality: **Where do execution traces get stored?**

**What the Roadmap Missed**:
- Execution traces are **per-pattern-execution** (not per-pattern-definition)
- User runs `smart_stock_analysis` on AAPL ‚Üí Generates trace #1
- User runs `smart_stock_analysis` on NVDA ‚Üí Generates trace #2
- **How to retrieve trace #1 later?**

**Options**:
1. **Session state** (Streamlit st.session_state)
   - Pros: Simple, no DB
   - Cons: Lost on page refresh, can't review old analyses

2. **File storage** (`storage/execution_traces/{user_id}/{trace_id}.json`)
   - Pros: Persistent, reviewable
   - Cons: File I/O overhead, no multi-user support

3. **Database** (SQLite for beta, Postgres for scale)
   - Pros: Queryable, multi-user ready
   - Cons: Requires DB setup (adds 1 day)

**Impact**:
- Week 4 Day 2 implementation incomplete without storage design
- Week 4 Day 3 provenance display **cannot retrieve historical traces**

**Solution Required**:
- **Pre-Week 4**: Design execution trace storage (0.5 days)
- **Week 4 Day 2**: Implement file-based storage (simpler for beta)
- **Post-PMF**: Migrate to database if usage justifies

**Estimated Delay**: +0.5 days (design)

---

### Gap 10: Click-to-Explain Requires KG Query Language (CRITICAL - Week 4 Blocker)
**Discovery**: Week 4 Day 4 simulation

**Problem**:
- Roadmap says: "Click 'Recession exposure: 0.72' ‚Üí Shows KG causal chain"
- Reality: **How does UI query KG for causal chain?**

**What the Roadmap Missed**:
- Current KG (from knowledge_graph.py): NetworkX graph with nodes/edges
- No built-in: "Given metric 'recession_exposure: 0.72', find causal path"
- **Need**: Query language or API

**Example**:
```python
# User clicks "Recession exposure: 0.72"
# UI needs to:
# 1. Parse metric ID: "portfolio.recession_exposure"
# 2. Query KG: "Show causal path from macro regime to this metric"
# 3. Return: Unemployment ‚Üë ‚Üí Consumer spending ‚Üì ‚Üí Tech sales ‚Üì ‚Üí NVDA ‚Üì

# But current KG only supports:
kg.get_node(node_id)  # Get single node
kg.get_neighbors(node_id)  # Get connected nodes
# No: kg.get_causal_path(source, target)
```

**Impact**:
- Week 4 Day 4 click-to-explain feature **cannot be implemented** without KG query refactor
- **Transparency differentiator incomplete**

**Solution Required**:
- **Week 1 Day 5**: Add `KG.query_causal_path(source, target)` method (during causal KG week)
- **Week 4 Day 4**: Use method in UI

**Estimated Delay**: Already included in Week 1 (+0 days)

---

### Gap 11: Rating Formulas Not Specified (CRITICAL - Week 5 Blocker)
**Discovery**: Week 5 Day 1 simulation

**Problem**:
- Roadmap says: "Dividend safety rating components: Payout ratio, FCF coverage, Balance sheet, Dividend growth, Macro sensitivity"
- Reality: **How are these combined into 0-10 score?**

**What the Roadmap Missed**:
- Rating formula needs to be **transparent** (core value prop)
- Example dividend safety:
  - Payout ratio < 50% ‚Üí +2 points
  - FCF coverage > 1.5x ‚Üí +2 points
  - Net cash ‚Üí +1.5 points
  - 10-year dividend growth ‚Üí +2 points
  - Recession beta < 0.5 ‚Üí +0.5 points
  - **But weights are arbitrary**

- **Competing approaches**:
  1. **Rules-based** (as above): Simple, transparent, but arbitrary weights
  2. **Statistical model** (logistic regression on historical dividend cuts): Accurate, but black box
  3. **Hybrid** (rules + backtesting): Transparent + validated

**Impact**:
- Week 5 Day 1-2 rating implementation **requires formula design**
- If formulas are wrong ‚Üí Users lose trust ("AAPL got 7.5/10 but T got 8/10? That's backwards.")

**Solution Required**:
- **Pre-Week 5**: Design rating formulas with backtesting (2 days)
  - Test on 2008 recession: Did stocks with 8+/10 avoid dividend cuts?
  - Adjust weights based on backtest
- **Week 5 Day 1-2**: Implement validated formulas

**Estimated Delay**: +2 days (Pre-Week 5 required)

---

### Gap 12: No User Authentication/Multi-Portfolio Support (CRITICAL - Beta Blocker)
**Discovery**: Week 7 simulation

**Problem**:
- Roadmap says: "Professional tier: Unlimited portfolios"
- Reality: **Current Streamlit app has NO user authentication**

**What the Roadmap Missed**:
- Streamlit is **single-user** by default (no login)
- Multi-portfolio requires:
  1. User accounts (login/signup)
  2. Portfolio ownership (user_id ‚Üí portfolio_id mapping)
  3. Data isolation (User A can't see User B's portfolios)
  4. Session management

**Impact**:
- Beta users can't have separate accounts ‚Üí Can't charge $149/mo
- Free tier vs Professional tier **cannot be enforced**
- **Revenue model broken**

**Solution Required**:
- **Week 7 Day 1-3**: Implement authentication
  - Option A: Streamlit-Authenticator library (simple, file-based)
  - Option B: Auth0/Firebase (better, but overhead)
- **Week 7 Day 4-5**: Multi-portfolio UI (portfolio selector dropdown)

**Recommendation**: Streamlit-Authenticator for beta, migrate to Auth0 post-PMF

**Estimated Delay**: +3 days (Week 7 extends to 8 days, pushes beta to Week 9)

---

## üü° MISSED OPPORTUNITIES (Reduce Competitive Advantage)

### Opportunity 1: No "Share Analysis" Feature (Viral Growth)
**What's Missing**:
- Individual investors want to share analyses with friends/Reddit
- Example: "Check out my DawsOS portfolio analysis: [link]"
- **Viral loop**: Share ‚Üí Friend clicks ‚Üí Sees value ‚Üí Signs up

**Why This Matters**:
- Roadmap focuses on: Individual usage (upload CSV, see analysis)
- Missed: Social sharing (viral acquisition)
- Competing tools: Seeking Alpha has "Share" button on every article

**Implementation**:
- **Week 5 Day 5** (or Week 6): Add "Share" button
  - Generates shareable link (read-only, expires 7 days)
  - Shows: Portfolio analysis, execution trace (transparency as hook)
  - CTA: "Sign up to analyze YOUR portfolio"

**Benefit**: 20-30% of beta users share ‚Üí 50% referral traffic

---

### Opportunity 2: No "Compare to Benchmark" Feature (Context for Metrics)
**What's Missing**:
- Individual investor sees: "Your portfolio: -1.2 rate beta"
- **Missing context**: "S&P 500: -0.8 rate beta. You're 50% more rate-sensitive."

**Why This Matters**:
- Metrics without context are **meaningless** to non-experts
- "Is -1.2 rate beta good or bad?" ‚Üí Need benchmark

**Implementation**:
- **Week 3 Day 2**: Add benchmark comparison to Portfolio Overview
  - Show: Portfolio beta vs S&P 500 beta (side-by-side bars)
  - Interpret: "Your portfolio is 50% more rate-sensitive than SPY"

**Benefit**: Makes metrics actionable for individuals

---

### Opportunity 3: No "Historical Performance" in Portfolio Tab
**What's Missing**:
- Portfolio tab shows: Current holdings, macro betas, scenarios
- Missing: **How did portfolio perform historically?**

**Why This Matters**:
- Individual investors care about: "Did I beat the market?"
- Current plan: No performance tracking

**Implementation**:
- **Week 6 Day 3**: Add historical performance chart
  - Uses Beancount ledger (transaction history) + Pricing packs (historical prices)
  - Shows: Portfolio value over time vs S&P 500

**Benefit**: Retention (users return to check performance)

---

### Opportunity 4: No "Quick Add" for Watchlist (Reduce Friction)
**What's Missing**:
- User sees great analysis on NVDA
- Wants to track NVDA (but not buy yet)
- **No "Add to watchlist" feature**

**Why This Matters**:
- Reduces friction between discovery and action
- Watchlist ‚Üí Nudges to portfolio upload (activation)

**Implementation**:
- **Week 5 Day 4**: Add "Add to watchlist" button (Stock Analysis page)
- **Week 6 Day 1**: Watchlist tab (tracks stocks, shows alerts)

**Benefit**: Engagement (users return to check watchlist)

---

### Opportunity 5: No "Tax Loss Harvesting" Suggestions (Professional Feature)
**What's Missing**:
- Professional tier ($149/mo) lacks **tax optimization** features
- Competing tools (Wealthfront, Betterment) have tax-loss harvesting

**Why This Matters**:
- High-value individual investors ($250K+ portfolios) care about taxes
- Tax loss harvesting can save $5K-20K/year ‚Üí Justifies $1,800/year subscription

**Implementation**:
- **Post-Week 8** (Week 9-10): Add tax loss harvesting suggestions
  - Uses Beancount ledger (lot-level tracking)
  - Finds: Positions with unrealized losses
  - Suggests: "Sell NVDA (Lot 2, -$5K loss) to offset capital gains"

**Benefit**: Premium feature justifies $149/mo pricing

---

### Opportunity 6: No "Email Alerts" (Retention Hook)
**What's Missing**:
- User uploads portfolio, sees analysis, leaves
- **No mechanism to bring user back**

**Why This Matters**:
- Email alerts drive retention
- Example: "Your portfolio recession risk increased from 0.65 ‚Üí 0.72 (macro regime changed)"

**Implementation**:
- **Week 6 Day 5**: Add alert preferences (email, frequency)
- **Week 8**: Implement email alerts (SendGrid/Mailgun)

**Benefit**: Retention (weekly emails bring users back)

---

### Opportunity 7: No "Portfolio Stress Test" (Scenario Analysis Enhancement)
**What's Missing**:
- Week 3 scenario analysis is **single-scenario**
- Missing: "Run 10 scenarios, show worst-case"

**Why This Matters**:
- Professional investors want **stress testing** (Monte Carlo)
- Example: "In 95% of recession scenarios, your portfolio loses 8-15%"

**Implementation**:
- **Week 6 Day 2**: Add stress test widget
  - Runs 100 simulations (recession severity, duration vary)
  - Shows: Distribution of outcomes (histogram)

**Benefit**: Professional-grade analytics (justifies $149/mo)

---

### Opportunity 8: No "Community Insights" (Network Effects)
**What's Missing**:
- Individual investors are isolated (can't see what others are doing)
- Missing: "Users with similar portfolios are reducing tech exposure"

**Why This Matters**:
- Network effects (more users ‚Üí more value)
- Privacy-preserving: Show aggregate trends, not individual holdings

**Implementation**:
- **Post-PMF** (Week 12+): Add "Community Insights"
  - Shows: "Tech-heavy portfolios: 60% reduced NVDA exposure this month"
  - Requires: User opt-in, anonymized aggregation

**Benefit**: Network effects (more users ‚Üí better insights)

---

## üü† HIDDEN DEPENDENCIES (Not Mentioned in Roadmap)

### Dependency 1: OpenBB Platform Upgrade Required
**Issue**: Current code uses OpenBB Platform 4.3.3 (from migration docs)
**Roadmap assumption**: OpenBB works out-of-box
**Reality**: OpenBB 4.3.3 has bugs (yfinance provider broken, equity.price.quote errors)
**Fix needed**: Upgrade to OpenBB 4.5+ OR implement yfinance fallback
**Timeline impact**: +0.5 days (Week 0)

---

### Dependency 2: FMP API Rate Limits
**Issue**: Free FMP tier = 250 requests/day
**Roadmap assumption**: Unlimited API calls
**Reality**: Pricing pack generation for 500 stocks = 500 requests (2 days of quota)
**Fix needed**: Implement rate limiting + caching OR upgrade to paid tier ($30/mo)
**Timeline impact**: +0.5 days (rate limit handling)

---

### Dependency 3: Streamlit Session State Persistence
**Issue**: st.session_state clears on page refresh
**Roadmap assumption**: Session state persists
**Reality**: User uploads CSV ‚Üí Refreshes page ‚Üí CSV lost
**Fix needed**: Implement persistent storage (file or DB)
**Timeline impact**: +1 day (Week 0 or Week 7)

---

### Dependency 4: Git Integration for Beancount Ledger
**Issue**: Roadmap says "Git-backed ledger" but doesn't specify how
**Reality**: Need automated git commits on CSV upload
**Fix needed**: Implement git wrapper (add, commit, push on ledger update)
**Timeline impact**: +0.5 days (Week 0 Day 3)

---

### Dependency 5: Beancount Validation Errors
**Issue**: Beancount has strict validation (unbalanced transactions fail)
**Roadmap assumption**: CSV ‚Üí Beancount conversion always succeeds
**Reality**: Missing data, rounding errors ‚Üí Validation fails
**Fix needed**: Implement error handling + user-friendly messages
**Timeline impact**: +0.5 days (Week 0 Day 2-3)

---

### Dependency 6: Pattern Execution Timeout
**Issue**: Complex patterns (smart_morning_briefing chains 5 patterns)
**Roadmap assumption**: Patterns execute quickly
**Reality**: Chained patterns with API calls = 10-30 seconds
**Fix needed**: Implement timeout + progress indicator
**Timeline impact**: +0.5 days (Week 2 Day 3)

---

### Dependency 7: KG Query Performance
**Issue**: NetworkX in-memory graph with 96K+ nodes
**Roadmap assumption**: KG queries are fast
**Reality**: `query_causal_path()` on large graph = 1-5 seconds
**Fix needed**: Implement caching or index
**Timeline impact**: +0.5 days (Week 1 Day 5)

---

### Dependency 8: CSV Upload File Size Limits
**Issue**: Streamlit default upload limit = 200MB
**Roadmap assumption**: Unlimited uploads
**Reality**: User with 20 years of Questrade history = 50MB CSV ‚Üí Works, but edge cases exist
**Fix needed**: Increase limit to 500MB (config) + add progress bar
**Timeline impact**: +0.2 days (Week 0 Day 2)

---

### Dependency 9: Multi-Currency FX Rate Synchronization
**Issue**: FX rates from yfinance vs FMP may differ
**Roadmap assumption**: FX rates are consistent
**Reality**: yfinance: 1.3500, FMP: 1.3505 ‚Üí Reproducibility breaks
**Fix needed**: Use single source (prioritize FMP, fallback to yfinance)
**Timeline impact**: +0.3 days (Week 2 Day 4)

---

### Dependency 10: Beancount Lot-Level Tracking Edge Cases
**Issue**: Stock splits, spinoffs, mergers
**Roadmap assumption**: Simple buy/sell transactions
**Reality**: NVDA 10:1 split ‚Üí Adjust all historical lots
**Fix needed**: Implement split handler
**Timeline impact**: +1 day (Week 0 Day 3 or deferred to post-beta)

---

### Dependency 11: Pattern Template Variable Resolution Failures
**Issue**: Pattern templates use `{step_3.score}` (nested field access)
**Roadmap assumption**: Agents return structured data
**Reality**: If step_3 returns string ‚Üí `{step_3.score}` renders as literal
**Fix needed**: Add fallback handling in pattern engine
**Timeline impact**: Already known issue (from CLAUDE.md), +0.5 days (Week 2 Day 3)

---

### Dependency 12: UI State Management for Multi-Tab Navigation
**Issue**: User uploads CSV on Portfolio tab, navigates to Stock Analysis ‚Üí CSV lost?
**Roadmap assumption**: Streamlit handles state
**Reality**: Need explicit session state management across tabs
**Fix needed**: Implement global state manager
**Timeline impact**: +0.5 days (Week 3 Day 1)

---

### Dependency 13: Error Handling for Missing Macro Exposures
**Issue**: User portfolio has TSLA, but macro_exposures.json only has S&P 500 stocks
**Roadmap assumption**: All stocks have exposures
**Reality**: Fallback needed (use sector average or show "N/A")
**Fix needed**: Implement fallback logic
**Timeline impact**: +0.3 days (Week 1 Day 5)

---

### Dependency 14: Pricing Pack Versioning
**Issue**: Pricing pack schema may change (add new fields)
**Roadmap assumption**: Schema is stable
**Reality**: Need versioning (v1.0, v1.1) to avoid breaking old packs
**Fix needed**: Add version field to pricing pack JSON
**Timeline impact**: +0.2 days (Week 0 Day 4)

---

### Dependency 15: Execution Trace Size Limits
**Issue**: Complex pattern chains generate large traces (10KB+ JSON)
**Roadmap assumption**: Traces are small
**Reality**: File storage fills up, slow to load
**Fix needed**: Implement trace retention policy (keep last 30 days)
**Timeline impact**: +0.3 days (Week 4 Day 2)

- Compile: Top 500 stocks with macro factor betas
- Deliverable: macro_exposures.json (curated from research)

**Day 3**: Causal Relationships Research
- Research: Economic theory for causal chains
- Validate: Simplified causality (directional, no elasticities for beta)
- Deliverable: causal_relationships.json (50 validated edges)

**Day 4**: Rating Formula Design
- Design: Dividend safety, moat, recession resilience formulas
- Backtest: 2008 recession (validate formulas)
- Deliverable: Rating formula specification

**Day 5**: Authentication & Multi-Portfolio Architecture
- Design: User accounts, portfolio ownership, data isolation
- Evaluate: Streamlit-Authenticator vs Auth0
- Deliverable: Authentication architecture doc

## üìä SIMULATION FINDINGS SUMMARY

### What the Simulation Revealed:

**1. CSV Parsing is 5x Harder Than Planned**
- Multiple broker formats, edge cases, validation
- **Fix**: Pre-Week 0 research + Week 0 extension

**2. Macro Exposures Dataset is 3-Month Project (Not 1 Day)**
- 500 stocks √ó 5 factors √ó 10 years data = 42 hours computation
- **Fix**: Use pre-existing research (3 days vs 3 months)

**3. Beancount Doesn't Store FX Rates (Critical Gap)**
- Need separate FX rate storage
- **Fix**: `storage/fx_rates/` directory + pricing pack integration

**4. Pattern Chaining Requires Core Refactor**
- Current PatternEngine doesn't support shared context
- **Fix**: Week 2 extends to 7 days (refactor + test)

**5. No Portfolio Tab Exists (Assumed It Did)**
- Week 3 is net-new development (not redesign)
- **Fix**: Week 3 extends to 6 days

**6. No User Authentication (Beta Blocker)**
- Can't charge $149/mo without user accounts
- **Fix**: Week 7 extends to 8 days, beta delayed to Week 9

**7. 8 Missed Opportunities**
- No sharing (viral growth)
- No benchmarks (context)
- No historical performance (retention)
- No watchlist (engagement)
- No tax optimization (premium feature)
- No email alerts (retention)
- No stress test (professional analytics)
- No community insights (network effects)

**8. 15 Hidden Dependencies**
- OpenBB upgrade, rate limits, session persistence, git integration, validation, timeouts, performance, file limits, FX sync, splits, template failures, state management, missing data, versioning, trace retention

---

## üéØ FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. Adopt 10-Week Roadmap (Not 8 Weeks)
**Rationale**: 17.5 days of gaps + dependencies = realistic 10-11 weeks

**Defer**:
- Watchlist (Week 9)
- Tax optimization (Week 10)
- Email alerts (Week 9)
- Stress test (Week 10)
- Community insights (Post-PMF)

---

### 4. Address All 12 Critical Gaps
**Must-fix**:
- Gap 1-6: Pre-Week 0 + Week 0-2 extensions
- Gap 7-8: Week 2-3 extensions
- Gap 9-11: Week 4-5 extensions
- Gap 12: Week 7 extension (authentication)

---

### 5. Mitigate 15 Hidden Dependencies
**Approach**: Add buffer time (0.5-1 day per week) for unexpected issues
