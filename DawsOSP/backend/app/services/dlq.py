"""
Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) Service

Purpose: Handle failed alert notifications with retry logic
Updated: 2025-10-23
Priority: P1 (Sprint 3 Week 6)

Features:
    - Push failed jobs to DLQ
    - Pop jobs for retry
    - Exponential backoff (1m, 5m, 30m)
    - Max 3 retry attempts
    - Ack/Nack for success/failure
    - Automatic cleanup after max retries

Retry Strategy:
    - Attempt 0: Immediate (initial failure)
    - Attempt 1: 1 minute delay
    - Attempt 2: 5 minute delay
    - Attempt 3: 30 minute delay
    - After 3 attempts: Mark as failed, stop retrying

DLQ Status Flow:
    pending → retrying → delivered (success)
    pending → retrying → failed (max attempts reached)

Usage:
    from backend.app.services.dlq import DLQService

    dlq_svc = DLQService()

    # Push failed job to DLQ
    await dlq_svc.push_to_dlq(
        alert_id="xxx",
        user_id="yyy",
        payload={"message": "...", "channels": {"email": True}},
        error="SMTP connection timeout"
    )

    # Pop jobs for retry (in hourly job)
    jobs = await dlq_svc.pop_from_dlq(limit=100)
    for job in jobs:
        try:
            # Retry delivery
            await retry_notification(job)
