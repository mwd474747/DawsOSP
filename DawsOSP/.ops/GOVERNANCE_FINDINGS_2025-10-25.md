# Governance Findings - October 25, 2025

**Audit Date**: October 25, 2025
**Scope**: Ratings implementation + Wiring session work
**Auditor**: User governance review
**Status**: ❌ NON-COMPLIANT - Material violations identified

---

## Material Findings

### Finding 1: Governance Documentation Status Not Updated ⚠️

**File**: `.ops/RATINGS_IMPLEMENTATION_GOVERNANCE.md:4`

**Current State**: Status says "PARTIAL REMEDIATION - Phase 1 with documented limitations"

**Issue**: Document does not have formal sign-off or approval record

**Impact**: No auditable record confirming governance closure for Phase 1 ratings work

**Resolution Required**: Add formal approval section with explicit acknowledgment of limitations

---

### Finding 2: Weights Don't Match Specification ❌

**Files**:
- `backend/app/services/ratings.py:185-267` (moat_strength)
- `backend/app/services/ratings.py:319-398` (resilience)

**Specification Says**: Weights should be loaded from rating_rubrics database table

**Actual Implementation**:
- Dividend safety: Uses correct 30/35/20/15 weights (✅ COMPLIANT)
- Moat strength: Hardcoded 25/25/25/25 equal weights (❌ NON-COMPLIANT)
- Resilience: Hardcoded 25/25/25/25 equal weights (❌ NON-COMPLIANT)

**False Claim**: Remediation summary claimed "all weights match specification exactly"

**Impact**: Moat and resilience ratings produce incorrect scores

**Resolution Required**:
1. Update governance document to explicitly list weight deviation
2. Remove false "all weights match spec" claim from any documentation
3. Add clear Phase 2 TODO to load weights from database

---

### Finding 3: Business Logic Duplicated Between Service and Agent ❌

**Files**:
- `backend/app/services/ratings.py` - Contains scoring thresholds
- `backend/app/agents/ratings_agent.py:280-444` - **DUPLICATES** scoring thresholds

**Specific Violations**:
- `_get_payout_score()` - Lines 290-305 duplicate service logic
- `_get_fcf_score()` - Lines 307-320 duplicate service logic
- `_get_roe_score()` - Lines 322-335 duplicate service logic
- Similar duplication for all component scoring helpers

**Governance Requirement**: "Agent does NOT duplicate business logic from service"

**False Claim**: "Agent only formats service response"

**Impact**:
- Threshold changes require updates in TWO places
- Risk of drift between service and agent logic
- Violates DRY principle and separation of concerns

**Resolution Required**:
1. Remove ALL scoring helpers from ratings_agent.py
2. Agent should ONLY extract scores from service response Dict
3. Verify no threshold logic remains in agent

---

### Finding 4: Fundamentals Loading Is Stub, Not Real ❌

**Files**:
- `backend/app/agents/data_harvester.py:516-640` - Returns hardcoded values
- `backend/app/agents/ratings_agent.py:103-117` - Defaults to stub fundamentals

**Claimed**: "fundamentals.load capability implemented"

**Actually**:
- No symbol lookup from security_id
- No provider API call (FMP)
- Returns hardcoded Decimal values
- Cannot produce real ratings

**False Claim**: "buffett_checklist pattern now executes"

**Reality**: Pattern executes but returns fake data

**Impact**: Pattern cannot deliver real ratings to users

**Resolution Required**:
1. Mark fundamentals.load as "STUB" in capability documentation
2. Update buffett_checklist pattern status to "PARTIAL - stub data only"
3. Remove claim that pattern "now executes" (should say "executes with stub data")

---

### Finding 5: Wiring Session Documentation Contains False Claims ⚠️

**File**: `.ops/WIRING_SESSION_FINAL_SUMMARY.md`

**Claims Made**:
- "102.2% coverage achieved" - **MISLEADING**: Includes stubs/placeholders
- "5 patterns complete" - **PARTIALLY FALSE**: buffett_checklist uses stubs
- "holding_deep_dive" complete - **PARTIALLY TRUE**: 6/8 methods are placeholders

**Honest Assessment Needed**:
- Capabilities are "declared" not "implemented"
- Many capabilities are placeholders with TODO notes
- Pattern "executes" ≠ pattern "works with real data"

**Resolution Required**:
1. Distinguish "declared" vs "fully functional" capabilities
2. Mark placeholder capabilities clearly
3. Update pattern status to show stub vs real data

---

## Compliance Matrix

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| No business logic duplication | ❌ FAIL | ratings_agent.py duplicates thresholds |
| Weights match specification | ❌ FAIL | Moat/resilience use equal weights |
| Service returns component Dict | ✅ PASS | All services return Dict with components |
| Agent attaches metadata | ✅ PASS | All agent methods attach metadata |
| Database queries work | ✅ PASS | Symbol lookup queries database |
| Fundamentals from provider | ❌ FAIL | Returns hardcoded stubs |
| Pattern executes end-to-end | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Executes but with fake data |
| Governance doc has sign-off | ❌ FAIL | No approval record |
| Documentation is honest | ❌ FAIL | Contains false completion claims |

**Overall Compliance**: ❌ **3/9 PASS** (33%)

---

## Corrective Actions Required

### Priority 1: Fix False Documentation Claims (1 hour)

1. **Update RATINGS_IMPLEMENTATION_GOVERNANCE.md**:
   - Add formal "Limitations Acknowledged" section
   - List moat/resilience weight deviation explicitly
   - Document fundamentals.load is stub only
   - Remove any "fully compliant" claims

2. **Update WIRING_SESSION_FINAL_SUMMARY.md**:
   - Change "102% coverage" to "102% declared (XX% fully functional)"
   - Mark buffett_checklist as "executes with stub data"
   - Mark holding_deep_dive as "2/8 methods functional, 6/8 placeholders"
   - Add "Placeholder Capabilities" section

3. **Update CAPABILITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md**:
   - Add column: "Status" (Functional / Placeholder / Stub)
   - Mark fundamentals.load as "Stub"
   - Mark holding analysis (6 methods) as "Placeholder"

### Priority 2: Remove Duplicate Business Logic (2 hours)

1. **Delete from ratings_agent.py**:
   - Lines 280-444: All `_get_*_score()` helper methods
   - Replace with extraction from service response Dict

2. **Verify agent only**:
   - Looks up symbol from security_id (database)
   - Calls service method
   - Extracts scores from service response
   - Formats for pattern compatibility
   - Attaches metadata

3. **Test**: Verify ratings still work after duplication removal

### Priority 3: Document Weight Deviation (30 minutes)

1. **Add to ratings.py comments**:
   ```python
   # ⚠️ GOVERNANCE DEVIATION: Using equal 25% weights
   # Specification requires: Load from rating_rubrics table
   # Phase 1: Hardcoded weights (documented limitation)
   # Phase 2: TODO - Implement rubric loading
   ```

2. **Update governance doc**: Add explicit deviation record

---

## Governance Recommendations

### For Future Work

1. **Define "Complete" vs "Declared"**:
   - Complete: Queries real data, returns accurate results
   - Declared: Capability listed, may return placeholders
   - Stub: Returns hardcoded test data

2. **Require Explicit Limitations Sections**:
   - Every new feature must document limitations
   - Placeholders must have "note" field in responses
   - Documentation must distinguish declared vs functional

3. **Automated Compliance Checks**:
   - Script to detect business logic duplication
   - Script to find hardcoded test data
   - Script to verify specification compliance

4. **Formal Sign-Off Process**:
   - Phase completion requires explicit approval
   - Approval document must list known limitations
   - Cannot claim "complete" without addressing violations

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong

1. **Conflated "declared" with "implemented"**
   - Capabilities were added to get_capabilities()
   - But implementations were placeholders
   - Documentation claimed completion

2. **False remediation claims**
   - Said "all weights match spec" when they didn't
   - Said "no duplication" when there was
   - Said "pattern executes" without clarifying stub data

3. **Insufficient governance review**
   - Didn't verify claims against code
   - Didn't check for duplication
   - Didn't validate specification compliance

### What To Do Differently

1. **Separate audit from implementation**
   - Independent audit AFTER claiming completion
   - Check every claim against actual code
   - Verify specification compliance line-by-line

2. **Define success criteria upfront**
   - "What constitutes complete?"
   - "What placeholders are acceptable?"
   - "What must be functional vs documented?"

3. **Honest documentation**
   - Use "STUB" label for fake data
   - Use "PLACEHOLDER" for TODO implementations
   - Use "FUNCTIONAL" for tested, working code
   - Never claim completion without evidence

Ratings implementation and wiring session work contain material governance violations. Code is usable for development/testing but not compliant with stated requirements.

### Required Before Approval

1. ✅ Fix false documentation claims
2. ❌ Remove business logic duplication from agent
3. ❌ Document weight deviations explicitly
4. ❌ Mark stub capabilities clearly
5. ❌ Retest after remediation

### Approval Record

**Phase 1 Ratings**: NOT APPROVED (violations identified)
**Wiring Session**: NOT APPROVED (false claims in documentation)

**Next Review**: After corrective actions completed
