### 4. Claude Code Implementation Guide

**CLAUDE_CODE_GUIDE.md** (comprehensive practical guide)
- Purpose: Using Claude Code in VS Code for agent-driven development
- 16 major sections:
  1. **Core Capabilities**: Repo-scale reasoning, multi-file edits, inline/panel chat, context injection, apply diff mode, task decomposition
  2. **Repository Setup**: ARCHITECTURAL_GUARDRAILS.md, VS Code settings, pre-commit hooks
  3. **Agent Implementation Workflows**: 3 detailed workflows (PROVIDER_INTEGRATOR, MACRO_ARCHITECT, TEST_ARCHITECT)
  4. **Prompt Patterns**: 4 template patterns (agent-driven, constrained refactor, test-first, performance budget)
  5. **Testing Strategies**: Golden test workflow, property test workflow, chaos test workflow
  6. **Infrastructure & DevEx**: Makefile generation, VS Code launch configs, Terraform infrastructure
  7. **Security & Compliance**: RLS/IDOR fuzzing, secret scanning, SBOM & SCA
  8. **Known Pitfalls**: Massive diffs, spec drift, provider costs, rights compliance gaps (with mitigations)
  9. **Example Build Sprint**: Day 1 (infra + truth spine), Day 2 (execution + metrics), Day 3 (UI + observability), Days 4-5 (macro/ratings/optimizer)
  10. **Reference Templates**: Agent implementation prompt, test generation prompt

- Key features:
  - **Repository-scale reasoning**: Claude Code can read entire repo and maintain mental map
  - **Multi-file diffs**: Proposes changes across modules/tests/configs in one pass
  - **Agent-driven**: Each `.claude/agents/*.md` spec becomes buildable contract
  - **Guardrail-aware**: Respects RLS, rights registry, reproducibility, SLOs
  - **Test automation**: Generates unit, property, golden, integration, security, chaos, performance tests
  - **Infrastructure as code**: Terraform, Helm, ECS, Makefile, VS Code configs
  - **Security compliance**: RLS/IDOR fuzzing, secret scanning, SBOM/SCA

- Prompt patterns library:
  - Agent-driven implementation
  - Constrained multi-file refactor
  - Test-first development
  - Performance budget enforcement
  - Golden test workflow
  - Property test workflow
  - Chaos test workflow

- Example prompts for each agent workflow

## Development Tools & Workflows

### Claude Code in VS Code
- **Repository-scale reasoning**: Understands full architecture
- **Multi-file diffs**: Proposes changes across modules/tests/configs
- **Agent-driven workflows**: Each agent spec → buildable contract
- **Guardrail enforcement**: RLS, rights registry, reproducibility, SLOs
- **Test automation**: 7 test types with fixtures/seeds
- **Infrastructure as code**: Terraform, Helm, ECS, Makefile

### Recommended Workflow
1. **Add context**: PRODUCT_SPEC, ARCHITECTURAL_GUARDRAILS, agent specs, seeds
2. **Use agent-driven prompts**: "Act as {AGENT_NAME} agent. Use spec as contract..."
3. **Request scoped diffs**: Constrain changes to specific directories
4. **Test-first development**: Write failing tests, then implementation
5. **Verify acceptance criteria**: After each task, check against agent spec
6. **Iterate**: Review diff, approve/decline, refine as needed

### Example Agent Prompt
```
Act as the PROVIDER_INTEGRATOR agent. Use `/.claude/agents/data/PROVIDER_INTEGRATOR.md`
as the contract.

Implement:
1. FMPClient with circuit breaker (3 failures → OPEN)
2. Rate limiting (120 req/min via token bucket)
3. Integration tests (circuit breaker, 429 retry)

Requirements:
- Use Pydantic DTOs
- All secrets from environment variables
- Type hints + docstrings
- Coverage ≥ 95%

Return single multi-file diff. Don't touch unrelated files.
```
