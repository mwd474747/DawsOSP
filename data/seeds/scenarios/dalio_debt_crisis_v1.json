  "research_basis": "Ray Dalio (2018). 'Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises'. Bridgewater Associates. Analyzes 48 debt crises from 1918-2018, identifying 3 primary deleveraging mechanisms: austerity, default/restructuring, and money printing. Each path has distinct asset class implications based on whether deleveraging is deflationary (austerity/default) or inflationary (money printing).",
