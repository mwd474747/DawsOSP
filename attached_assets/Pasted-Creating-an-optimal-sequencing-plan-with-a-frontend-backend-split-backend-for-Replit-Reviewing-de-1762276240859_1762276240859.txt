## Optimal sequencing plan summary

### Work distribution

**Replit (Backend):** 60% of work (20 days over 4 weeks)
- Week 0: 5 days (Database + Security) - BLOCKS ALL
- Week 1: 3 days (Pattern Preparation)
- Week 2: 2 days (Pattern Consolidation)
- Week 3: 5 days (Reliability + Data Integrity)
- Week 4: 2 days (Performance Optimization)
- Week 5: 3 days (Testing + Deployment)

**Claude IDE (Frontend):** 40% of work (12 days over 2.4 weeks)
- Week 0: 0 days (Waiting for backend)
- Week 1: 2 days (Field Name Updates)
- Week 2: 3 days (Pattern Refactoring)
- Week 3: 0 days (Waiting for backend)
- Week 4: 3 days (Error Handling + Cleanup)
- Week 5: 4 days (Testing + Documentation)

**Parallel work:** 8 days (both agents working simultaneously)

## Sequencing strategy

### Week 0: Foundation (Backend first) — blocks all

**Replit (Backend):**
- Days 1-2: Database field standardization (P0 - BLOCKS ALL)
- Days 3-4: Database integrity + connection pooling
- Day 5: Security fixes (unsafe eval, authorization)

**Handoff to Frontend:** Database standardized, backend ready

---

### Week 1-2: Frontend updates + Backend refactoring

**Parallel work:**
- Replit (Days 3-5): Backend pattern preparation
- Claude IDE (Days 1-2): Frontend field name updates

**Dependencies:**
- Frontend needs standardized field names (Week 0 complete)
- Backend needs frontend updates complete (Week 1 complete)

**Sequential work:**
- Claude IDE (Days 1-3): Frontend pattern refactoring (needs backend prep)
- Replit (Days 4-5): Backend pattern consolidation (needs frontend prep)

---

### Week 3: Complete system fixes (Backend)

**Replit (Backend):**
- Days 1-2: Reliability fixes (timeout, cancellation, templates)
- Days 3-4: Data integrity fixes (validation, transactions, input validation, rate limiting)
- Day 5: Error handling standardization

**Handoff to Frontend:** Backend standardized and ready

---

### Week 4: Frontend integration + Backend optimization

**Parallel work:**
- Claude IDE (Days 1-2): Frontend error handling + auth
- Replit (Days 3-4): Backend performance optimization

**Sequential work:**
- Claude IDE (Day 5): Frontend code cleanup

---

### Week 5: Final integration + validation

**Both agents (coordinated):**
- Days 1-2: Comprehensive testing
- Claude IDE (Days 3-4): Documentation + final validation
- Replit (Day 5): Production deployment

---

## Handoff points

### Week 0 → Week 1
**Replit Handoff to Claude IDE:**
- Database field names standardized
- Backend code updated
- All patterns execute successfully
- Security fixes complete

---

### Week 1 → Week 2
**Replit Handoff to Claude IDE:**
- Panel definitions in backend JSON
- Pattern responses include panel metadata
- Pydantic schemas created

---

### Week 2 → Week 3
**Claude IDE Handoff to Replit:**
- Frontend pattern registry eliminated
- PatternRenderer reads from backend JSON
- UI renders correctly

---

### Week 3 → Week 4
**Replit Handoff to Claude IDE:**
- Error handling standardized
- Structured error response format
- Error code taxonomy

---

### Week 4 → Week 5
**Both Agents Handoff:**
- Frontend integration complete
- Backend optimization complete
- Code cleanup complete

---

## Parallel work opportunities

**Week 1-2:**
- Backend pattern preparation (Days 3-5) + Frontend field name updates (Days 1-2)
- Backend pattern consolidation (Days 4-5) + Frontend pattern refactoring (Days 1-3)

**Week 3-4:**
- Backend fixes (Week 3) + Frontend error handling preparation (Week 3)
- Backend optimization (Days 3-4) + Frontend error handling (Days 1-2)

**Week 4-5:**
- Frontend cleanup (Day 5) + Backend deployment preparation (Day 5)

---

## Critical dependencies

**Must complete in order:**
```
WEEK 0: Database Field Standardization (Replit)
    ↓ BLOCKS
WEEK 1: Frontend Field Name Updates (Claude IDE)
    ↓ REQUIRES
WEEK 1: Backend Pattern Preparation (Replit)
    ↓ REQUIRES
WEEK 2: Frontend Pattern Refactoring (Claude IDE)
    ↓ REQUIRES
WEEK 2: Backend Pattern Consolidation (Replit)
    ↓ REQUIRES
WEEK 3: Complete System Fixes (Replit)
    ↓ REQUIRES
WEEK 4: Frontend Integration (Claude IDE) + Backend Optimization (Replit)
    ↓ REQUIRES
WEEK 5: Final Integration + Validation (Both)
```

## Coordination protocol

**Daily standups:**
- Both agents update `AGENT_CONVERSATION_MEMORY.md` daily
- Format: Completed, In Progress, Blocked, Next

**Handoff protocol:**
- Agent completes work → Updates shared memory → Tags other agent
- Other agent reviews → Confirms ready → Begins work

**Conflict resolution:**
- Identify conflict → Assess impact → Resolve → Document

---

## Timeline summary

**Total duration:** 5 weeks (25 working days)

**Replit (Backend):** 20 days (4 weeks)
**Claude IDE (Frontend):** 12 days (2.4 weeks)
**Parallel work:** 8 days

The plan is committed and ready for execution. Should I update the shared memory document with this sequencing plan, or start Week 0 (Replit: Database Field Standardization)?
