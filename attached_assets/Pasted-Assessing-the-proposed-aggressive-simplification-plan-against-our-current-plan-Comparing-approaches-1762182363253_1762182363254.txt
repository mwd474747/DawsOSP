Completed the assessment comparing the aggressive simplification plan to the conservative plan.

## Executive summary

Verdict: the aggressive plan is more appropriate for alpha stability, with a refined hybrid that balances simplification and risk.

### Findings

1. Fixes root causes vs documents symptoms
   - Conservative: documents nested storage, field naming, unused tables
   - Aggressive: fixes nested storage, standardizes fields, removes unused tables
   - Result: fixing removes the issues, not just documenting them

2. Reduces actual complexity
   - Conservative: keeps 33 tables (15 used, 18 unclear)
   - Aggressive: reduces to ~18 active tables
   - Result: lower complexity and cognitive load

3. Faster to alpha
   - Conservative: 18-36 hours
   - Aggressive: 12-17 hours
   - Refined Hybrid: 10.5-15.5 hours
   - Result: faster and better outcome

### Recommendation: Refined hybrid approach

A hybrid plan that:
- Fixes root causes (not just documents)
- Removes unused complexity (with verification first)
- Manages risks (comprehensive testing)
- Achieves simplification faster (10.5-15.5 hours vs 18-36)

### Critical validation from codebase

- Tables exist but are unused: `factor_exposures` and `currency_attribution` exist (hypertables with 1 row each) but are computed on-demand
- Safe to remove: verified no active queries against these tables
- Nested storage fixable: orchestrator flattening is viable and testable

The document includes:
- Plan comparison
- Risk assessment
- Refined 3-phase implementation plan
- Validation checklist
- Expected outcomes

Assessment saved to `SIMPLIFICATION_PLAN_ASSESSMENT.md`. Recommendation: proceed with the refined hybrid approach — it fixes root causes, reduces complexity, and manages risk.
