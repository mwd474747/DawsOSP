**Key Updates**:
```markdown
**[agent_orchestrator.md]** - Agent System & Capabilities

```

### 4. AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE_2025-10-27.md
**Changes**:
- Corrected capability baseline: 53 → 55 ✅

## Documentation Accuracy Assessment

### Before This Session
- ❌ Claimed 53 capabilities (was aspirational from migration docs)
- ❌ Claimed 7 agents (was correct but outdated)
- ❌ Claimed 649 tests (was correct but outdated)
- ⚠️ Some patterns claimed "operational" but were blocked

### After This Session
- ✅ Verified 57 capabilities (55 before + 2 new)
- ✅ Verified 9 agents (all registered in executor.py)
- ✅ Verified 668 tests (all collected via pytest)
- ✅ All 12 patterns now operational (0 blocked)

---

## Verification Methodology

Used 5-pass code-first verification:

1. **Pass 1: File Existence**
   - `ls -lh` on all new files
   - Confirmed sizes and timestamps

2. **Pass 2: Registration Verification**
   - `grep -c "register_agent"` for agent count
   - Code inspection of executor.py imports

3. **Pass 3: Capability Declaration**
   - Read `get_capabilities()` methods in each agent
   - Counted capability strings with regex

4. **Pass 4: Test Collection**
   - `pytest --collect-only` for total count
   - Individual test file collection counts

5. **Pass 5: Pattern Requirements**
   - grep pattern JSON files for capability references
   - Cross-referenced with agent implementations
